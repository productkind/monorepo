## Commit Message Guidelines

Follow the [this guide](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/) for writing good commit messages. Here are some
key points to remember:

 1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
 2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
 3. Capitalize the subject line
 4. Do not end the subject line with a period
 5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
 6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
 7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

 Because this is a monorepo we also ask that you include the corresponding emoji as the first
 character of the subject line. The emojis can be found in the [README](README.md) file.
 Use the following emoji if the commit is general or monorepo related: üåè
