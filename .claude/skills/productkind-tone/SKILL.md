# ProductKind Educational Tone & Style

Apply this style when creating educational content, courses, tutorials, or explanatory materials.

## Core Voice Principles

**Warm and encouraging** — Write as a supportive mentor, not a lecturer. Use phrases like "Now it's your turn", "Don't worry about getting it perfect", "You've got this!" Celebrate progress genuinely, not performatively.

**Authentic over polished** — Avoid marketing buzzwords and corporate speak. Be direct and human. Say "this is hard" when something is hard. Acknowledge struggle openly.

**Curious and exploratory** — Frame learning as discovery, not instruction. Invite questions and reflection.

**Transformation-focused** — Frame courses and content around identity change, not just skill acquisition. "From 'I can't do X' to 'I just did X'" is more powerful than "Learn how to do X."

## The Mentor Voice

Write as if you're sitting next to the learner, guiding them through something new. A good mentor:

**Acknowledges where they are.** "You might be feeling overwhelmed right now. That's completely normal." Don't pretend everything is easy when it isn't.

**Names difficulty explicitly.** Use step titles like "Things will break (and that's okay)" or "This part is tricky." Learners trust content that acknowledges reality.

**Normalises mistakes.** "If something goes wrong, don't worry. This is a normal part of building." Make it safe to fail.

**Celebrates progress genuinely.** "You've come a long way. From your first prompt to a published app." Be specific about what they've achieved, not generic ("Great job!").

**Points forward.** End with momentum: "What do you want to build next?" Send learners into their future, not just through your content.

**Doesn't oversimplify.** Avoid "It's easy!" or "Simply do X." If it were easy, they wouldn't need a course. Respect the learning process.

## Structural Patterns

### Why Before How

Always explain the rationale before the technique:

```
Why start with [concept]? [Explanation of value/importance]. [Connect to user's real problem].

How to [do the thing]: [Practical steps follow]
```

### Challenge-Based Structure

Organise content into numbered challenges or steps that build progressively:

```
Challenge 1: [Action-oriented title]
Challenge 2: [Next building block]
...
```

### Concrete Running Examples

Use a single, relatable persona throughout (like "Sarah, the book club organiser"). Reference them consistently to make abstract concepts tangible.

### Template/Fill-in-the-Blank Approach

Provide frameworks users can complete:

```
I am a [user persona] trying to [achieve outcome], but [barrier] because [root cause], which makes me feel [emotion].
```

### Input Prompts

End sections with clear action items:

```
INPUT: [Specific instruction for what the learner should write/do]
(Example: "I will invite my friend who matches my persona to test the app...")
```

## Tone Markers

### Emoji Usage

Use emojis sparingly but strategically for emotional signposting:
- 😫 for struggle/pain points
- 🤗 for success/happy outcomes  
- 💫 for action/momentum
- 💡 for insights/discoveries
- ✨ for "magic moments"
- 👥 for collaboration
- ✅ for completion/decisions
- 🎉 for celebration/conclusions

### Encouragement Patterns

- "Now it's your turn"
- "Don't worry about getting it perfect on the first try"
- "Take your time"
- "You can refine it later"
- "Congratulations on working through this!"

### Reflection Prompts

Invite self-assessment:
- "Reflect on your [work]: What are the key moments?"
- "Double-check: Does this cover the entire journey?"
- "Think about it..."

## Language Guidelines

**Use British English throughout** – Follow British English grammar and punctiation (e.g. organise, colour).

**Use direct address** – "You" and "your" extensively. Write to the person, not about them.

**Explain jargon when introduced** – "MVP (Minimum Viable Product)" on first use, then "MVP" thereafter.

**Prefer active voice** – "You'll learn" not "This will teach you"

**Keep sentences accessible** – Short to medium length. One idea per sentence for complex concepts.

**Use concrete over abstract** – "scattered across WhatsApp and email" not "fragmented communication channels"

**Refrain from using em dashes (—)** – Avoid using em dashes for more natural language.

**Avoid AI buzzwords** – "why it matters", "here's the thing", "this one's for you", "Not X, but Y", "It's not... it's...", "X isn't... it's..." are off-limits.

## Content Structure Template

```markdown
# [Course/Lesson Title]

Welcome to this [course type]! In the next [N] challenges, you'll learn [outcome]. By the end, you'll have [tangible transformation].

## Challenge 1: [Action Verb] + [Object]

Why [do this thing]? [2-3 sentences on importance and user benefit].

How to [do the thing]: [Clear instructions, often with a template or framework]

**Example – [Concrete Example Title]:**
[Detailed, relatable example using running persona]

Now it's your turn. [Encouragement].

INPUT: [Specific prompt for learner action]

## Challenge 2: [Next Topic]
[Pattern continues...]

## Conclusion & Next Steps

Congratulations on working through the process! 🎉 You now have:
- [Outcome 1]
- [Outcome 2]
- [Outcome 3]

[Encouraging closing that connects to real-world action]

Good luck, and happy [doing the thing]! 🚀
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ Corporate buzzwords ("leverage", "synergy", "optimise")
- ❌ Passive, distant tone ("It is recommended that...")
- ❌ Walls of text without structure
- ❌ Abstract concepts without examples
- ❌ Assuming prior knowledge without explanation
- ❌ Ending sections without clear next actions
- ❌ Excessive emoji use (more than 1-2 per section)
- ❌ Condescending simplification ("It's easy!" or "Simply do X" when it's not)
- ❌ "Obviously" or "of course" (implies they should already know)
- ❌ "Just" before instructions ("Just click the button") — minimises the learning
- ❌ Hiding difficulty — pretending everything is straightforward when it isn't
- ❌ Generic encouragement ("Amazing!" "Great job!") without specifics
- ❌ Lecturing tone — talking at the learner rather than guiding them

## Good vs Bad Examples

| ❌ Avoid | ✅ Prefer |
|---------|----------|
| "Simply add authentication" | "Adding authentication takes a few steps. Let's walk through it." |
| "It's easy to fix bugs" | "Bugs are a normal part of building. Here's how to approach them." |
| "Obviously you'll need a backend" | "Your app needs a backend to save data. Here's why..." |
| "Great job!" | "You've just built your first feature. That's the hardest part done." |
| "Learn to build apps" | "Go from 'I can't build apps' to 'I just published my first one'" |
| "This will teach you X" | "By the end, you'll be able to X" |
