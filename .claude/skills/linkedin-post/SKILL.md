## Audience

Non-technical women learning AI-assisted development.

## Channel Guidelines

### LinkedIn Posts
- Length: 90–200 words optimal
- Structure: Hook → insight → implication
- One idea per post
- No hashtags
- Whitespace between paragraphs for scannability
- The opening sentence promises concrete professional benefit
- End with a question or implication, not a summary
- Value density: concentrated insights outperform verbose posts

### Substack Notes
- More reflective, longer-form thinking allowed
- Can explore nuance and uncertainty
- Still no jargon or hype

## Openings

**Do:**
- Strong opening lines that promise immediate value
- Start with a specific moment, frustration, or observation
- Reframe a common belief
- Name a practical distinction people miss

**Don't:**
- Grand claims about industries or "the future"
- Rhetorical questions as hooks
- Abstract definitions before context

### Examples of Hooks

#### Good: Curiosity Gap

> I discovered why 87% of LinkedIn outreach fails. The reason surprised even me.

**Why it works:** It promises specific, valuable information while creating mystery. The reader’s brain compels them to continue.

---

#### Good: Pattern Interrupt

> Forget everything you know about LinkedIn algorithms. It’s simpler than experts claim.

**Why it works:** It challenges conventional wisdom and signals a fresh perspective that contradicts what most people believe.

---

#### Good: Data-backed

> Three LinkedIn message templates that generated $157K in 30 days.

**Why it works:** The specificity of both metrics signals rigorous, measurable results, not vague claims.

---

#### Good: Social Proof

> My client’s LinkedIn post reached 1.2 million views last week using this structure.

**Why it works:** Extreme results create curiosity about the METHOD, readers think "If they did it, I can too."

---

#### Bad: Hyperbolic

> The LinkedIn secret nobody talks about

**Why it fails:** Hyperbolic opener. Overpromising without delivering and too vague.

---

#### Bad: Vague

> LinkedIn is important

**Why it fails:** Vague language.

---

#### Bad: Condescending

> If you’re still doing this, you’re making a huge mistake

**Why it fails:** Negative, condescending tone.

## Structure

- Lead with the point, then support it
- Use whitespace generously
- Bullet points when they reduce cognitive load
- Headings as signposts, not marketing hooks
- End with a practical reframe or behavioural guidance, not a summary

## Self-Check

Before publishing, verify:

1. Does the opening give a usable insight within the first two sentences?
2. Is there a specific example, tool, or scenario?
3. Does the ending advance thinking rather than summarise?
4. Would I trust this if someone else wrote it?
