description: Use this checklist when generating an outline for a micro-course from a messy draft. Every outline must meet these criteria before being considered complete.

## Important Aspects to Follow
- You don't have to follow the exact structure of the messy draft given. It's important that you craft the outline in a way that engages learners and help them efficiently acquire new skills.
- It's crucial to include an 'aha!' moment in the first challenge and make its hook powerful, because the learner will decide based on the first challenge if they want to subscribe for the micro-course.
- The learner should encounter a practical and hands-on step in the micro-course as soon as possible. Build their mindset during the micro-course, connecting it to practical experiences, not in a separate challenge focusing only on the mindset.
- Include in the description the transformation the learner will realise by the end. Include what the learner will be able to do after completing the micro-course.

## Narrative Structure

**Start with a relatable problem, not a lesson.** Use comics or a story to show someone's frustration before any teaching begins. Learners should feel "that's me" before they learn anything.

**Transformation hook in the first video/intro.** Frame the course as identity change: "From X to Y." Not "You'll learn A, B, C" but "You'll become someone who..." Example: "From 'I can't build apps' to 'I just published my first one.'"

**One running example throughout.** Use a single persona building a single project across all challenges. Don't switch examples mid-course. Consistency makes abstract concepts tangible and helps learners follow along.

## Output Format for Generated Outline

When generating a structured draft, structure it as the examples.
