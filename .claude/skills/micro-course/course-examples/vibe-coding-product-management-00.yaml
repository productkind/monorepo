              A dalmatian dog (called Dalmie) wearing a red shirt and yellow trousers stands in
              front of a large empty whiteboard, holding a sticky note. Dalmie says, “Let’s figure

              When you start working on an app idea, it can be hard to know where to begin. In this
              micro-course, you’ll define the problem you want to solve, understand your target
              user, and sketch a simple storyboard that shows how your product helps them. You’ll
              then break your idea into buildable steps using user story mapping, shape a focused
              minimum viable product, and turn it into a clear prompt for an AI app builder.
              You’ll finish with a small, workable version of your idea and a plan for gathering
              early feedback. Most importantly, you’ll see that you can move an idea forward one
              clear step at a time.

              Before building anything, pause and ask: **What problem will this solve for the user of my digital product?** Great products solve a problem, fulfil a need or desire for your user. If you skip this step, you might create something nobody truly needs or wants.

            body: |-
              With a clear story in mind, it's time to break down your solution into pieces that you can build. We'll do this with user story mapping.

              **User stories** were first introduced in the late 1990s by a developer who encouraged teams to move away from handing over lengthy requirements documents about what to build. Reading a document often leads to individual interpretations, and makes it harder to know if everyone is aligned.

          content:
            body: By talking about what a user wants to do in the product, the team can build a shared understanding of the problem and make better decisions about what to build. This helps us focus on delivering something truly valuable for the people who will use our product.
          subtitle: The idea behind user stories is **not to create more written documentation**, but **to elicit conversations**.

          title: What is user story mapping?
          content:
            body: |-
              The technique of **user story mapping** helps you break down an idea into small pieces you can build.

              Once you mapped out what your user will do in your product, you can understand better your whole product experience, and see a granular map of what your product needs to do.

              This makes it easier to decide what to build first, stay focused, and avoid feeling overwhelmed. It also keeps attention on the user and the parts of the product that are the most valuable for them.

              - **Speed and focus:** With fewer features, you can develop and launch quickly. This means you get your solution into users' hands sooner.
              - **User feedback:** An MVP allows you to test your assumptions. You can find out early if you're solving the right problem. If not, you can pivot or adjust with less wasted work.
              - **Resource savings:** You avoid spending time and money on features that users don't actually need or want. Build the core that matters most, and save the 'nice-to-haves' for later.
              - **Clarity:** For you and your team, an MVP forces clarity on what's truly essential. It's easy to get caught up thinking everything is important. But when you constrain scope, you make tough choices about what will have the biggest impact on the user's problem.

              You can decide what to build first by **revisiting your problem statement**. What did you want to solve for your users?

              Then look at your **user story map** and pick out the must-have functionalities that will help solve that core problem.

              Often, the MVP is a subset of your story map, maybe the first one or two activities, or even just a single core workflow, while other nice features are left out initially. It could happen that some steps within an activity, or certain details are skipped or simplified to keep things minimal.

              Remember, it's tempting to add more, but **keep it lean**. A smaller scope means you can build and test sooner. You can always expand once you've validated the core idea!

               You can draw horizontal lines on your user story map to visualise the MVP scope versus future releases. The MVP is the **top section**, everything below is **for later**.

              Notice how **many steps are completely excluded** from the MVP because none of their details are essential at this stage. And in some steps, **only one or two details are included**, which means only that small slice of the step appears in the MVP.

              A step only makes it into the MVP if you choose to include any of its details. If none of its details are included, then the entire step is left out for now. The same goes for an activity.

              So we are only addressing two activities in the MVP, because those are the most important for Sarah.

              We can exclude features like user profiles, notifications, discussion forums, etc., in the first version. Those aren't strictly needed to solve the immediate problem (though they might be nice later).

            body: |-
              When you're building with Lovable or any AI tool, it's best to go step-by-step.

              After the initial build, test what you have, then use follow-up prompts to add the next most important feature, fix something that isn't right, or polish the design.

              This iterative cycle is how you co-create with AI effectively.

              You've defined the problem, designed a solution, and soon you'll have a first version built. Fantastic!

              Now, don't wait for perfection: **get it in front of real users as soon as you can**. Testing early will save you tons of time and heartache.
          subtitle: Don't wait until it's "perfect". Showing real people now will make your product better.

              When you show your product (or even just a prototype) to users, you learn what works and what doesn't. Maybe something you thought was crystal clear actually confuses them. Or they might tell you about a need you hadn't thought of.

              Early user testing helps you catch these things before you invest too much in building more. As the Lean Startup mantra goes: you want to "build – measure – learn" in quick cycles.

              In practice, "testing" could be as simple as showing your MVP to a few target users (maybe colleagues, friends, or friendly potential customers who fit your persona) and asking them to use it.

              Watch how they use it. Do they get stuck anywhere? What do they love, and what would they change?

              The goal isn't to prove you're right, it's to learn. Be open to what you hear. If Sarah says, "I wish it could do X," or "I didn't understand this part," that's gold. It shows you where to improve. We can do all the research in the world, but nothing beats that first customer trying the product.

              For the book club app, testing might involve **asking a couple of book club organisers** to try coordinating their next pick with the app. **Their feedback** (e.g., "It was great except I wish I could notify people in-app rather than separately") would directly **inform what to build next** (maybe notifications become a priority).

              We might also **learn that some features we thought were essential aren't used much**, allowing us to learn about the reasons (e.g., maybe users didn't find them, didn't understand how they work, or simply they are not as useful as we thought they were).

              Ideally, someone who **matches your persona** or at least has the problem you're solving. It could be a friend, a co-worker, or a small group of potential users. **You don't need a fully polished MVP to start testing** – even the early version from Lovable is fine.

              Remember, early testers are usually forgiving. They know it's a work in progress. Involve them and they'll feel invested in your product's success. So, take a deep breath and share your creation. You'll be glad you did!
