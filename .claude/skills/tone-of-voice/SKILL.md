## Audience

Assume intelligent adults who are time-poor, skeptical of hype, and allergic to corporate speak. They value practical insight over inspiration.

## Core Principle

Clarity through care. Writing exists to reduce confusion and enable action, not to signal intelligence or status. Make complex ideas feel navigable and actionable.

## Language

Use British English throughout (organisation, behaviour, colour, prioritise).

---

## Voice

**Be:** Friendly, engaging, understated, natural, mentor-like, succinct and straightforward.

**Avoid:** Guru positioning, exaggerating tone, corporate polish, motivational fluff.

**The test:** Would a smart, busy professional trust this? Does it respect the reader's intelligence?

game-changing, mind-blowing

### Drama words
hack, chaos, crisis, fluff, hype

### Business jargon

### Empty fillers
but here’s the catch, to cut through the chaos, that moment stuck with me, cutting through the noise, that actually lands, that sticks

### Pseudo punchlines
Here's the thing, Bottom line:, No fluff, This one's for you, Why this matters, What moved me, This matters because

### Rhetorical formulas
"Not X, but Y", "It's not... it's...", "X isn't... it's...", "In this piece"

## Preferred Moves

| Instead of | Write |
|------------|-------|
| "This is a game-changer" | Describe the specific change it enables |
| "Best practices for X" | "What works for X in [specific context]" |
| "The key takeaway is..." | Just state it |
| "What people don't realise is..." | Just state the thing |
| Long wind-up | Start with the point |
| Generic example | Named tool, real scenario |

## Self-Check

Before publishing, verify:

1. Have I cut all banned words and phrases?
2. Have I respected the formatting guide?
3. Would I trust this if someone else wrote it?
