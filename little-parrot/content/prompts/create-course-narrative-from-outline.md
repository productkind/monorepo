## Prompt
I'm designing a new micro-course for Little Parrot. It's about helping a novice Lovable user build a valuable product. The goal is that they can break down their idea to manageable pieces and they can walk away with a clear plan how to prompt an AI-development tool to build their product.

Below you can see the draft of the learning material. Create this micro course based on the draft below.

### Draft
What problem you're solving for your user  
Explain why a problem statement helps  
TEXT It’s important to make sure that you fully understand what problem you want to solve for your users. Deeply understanding the problem will result in coming up with better solutions.  
Problem statement  
I am [your user] I am trying to [desired outcome] But [barrier / problem] Because [root of problem] Which makes me feel [emotions]  
I am a busy product manager I am trying to feel confident But I don’t even know where to start to get actual skills Because I don’t know what the best framework or methodology to apply is and I don’t find real practical resources Which makes me feel overwhelmed and paralysed.  
I am a book club organiser I am trying to keep our monthly book club running smoothly and make sure everyone stays engaged But our coordination is a complete mess - messages are scattered across WhatsApp, and email, book suggestions get lost, and we end up picking randomly just to avoid the chaos Because there's no central place to organise everything, and group chats become overwhelming with off-topic messages burying the important stuff Which makes me feel frustrated and exhausted, like I'm spending more time organising than actually reading and enjoying books with friends  
Who is your target user  
TEXT   A persona is an archetype, it’s a fictional, yet realistic, description of your typical user.  
TEXT   Use a simplified way to define your persona, focusing on their main characteristics, frustrations, and goals.  Persona:  About:  Frustrations: ﻿﻿Goals:  
TEXT Understanding who you’re designing a solution for is essential. It helps to build empathy for your user.  
TEXT   Persona: Sarah, the overwhelmed book club organiser About: Started a book club with friends Loves reading but has limited free time Comfortable with basic apps Not technical but willing to try simple tools Frustrations: "I can't find the book suggestion in the chat history" "We spend 30 minutes each meeting just figuring out what to read next" "Half the group doesn't vote because they miss the message" "I feel like a nag constantly reminding people about deadlines" Goals: Spend maximum 10 minutes per month on book club admin Get everyone to actually participate in choosing books Never lose a good book suggestion again Keep the club fun, not let it become a chore  
INPUT   Create your persona description.   Persona: [placeholder text: Sarah, the overwhelmed book club organiser]  
INPUT   Create your persona description.   About: [placeholder text: Loves reading but has limited free time]  
INPUT   Create your persona description.   Frustrations: [placeholder text: "I can't find the book suggestion in the chat history"]  
INPUT   Create your persona description.   Goals: [placeholder text: Spend maximum 10 minutes per month on book club admin]  
Explain persona  
Storyboard: From Struggle to Solution  
TEXT   The steps of the storyboard are the following: 1. Draw what the user struggles with. 2. ﻿﻿﻿Visualise what the user can do and how they feel once the struggle is resolved. ﻿﻿﻿3. Sketch all the moments that lead the user from the initial struggling moment to their happy ending. Show how your solution helps them get there.  
DRAWING   Panel 1: The Struggle 😫 Scene: Sarah at her kitchen table, phone in hand, looking stressed Multiple chat bubbles floating around her head (WhatsApp, Email, Text) Coffee cup and aspirin bottle on table Clock showing late evening Thought bubble: "Did Jake suggest that mystery novel or was it Jamie? And which chat was it in?" Caption: "Another month, another chaotic book selection process"  
DRAWING   Panel 2: The Happy Ending 😊 Scene: Sarah relaxed on her couch with a book and wine Laptop showing a clean, simple list of books Phone face-down (not needed!) Thought bubble: "Everyone voted, we picked a great book, and it took 2 minutes!" Big smile, actually reading Caption: "Book club is fun again - it runs itself!"  
DRAWING   Panel 3-6: The Journey (How We Get There) Panel 3: Discovery Moment 💡 Sarah creates "Sarah's Book Squad" with one click Simple screen: Just a text box saying "Name your club" Her expression: Cautiously optimistic "Could it really be this simple?" Panel 4: The First Magic ✨ Sarah adds 3 book suggestions in 30 seconds Her friend Emma's suggestion appears instantly when Emma adds it No login needed - just shared the link in their group "Everyone can see everything in one place!" Panel 5: The Group Joins In 👥 Phone screen showing 5 friends have added books List has grown to 12 suggestions Everyone's name next to their suggestion Sarah's surprise: "They're actually participating!" "More suggestions in one day than the last three months combined" Panel 6: Decision Made - Peace Achieved ✅ Monday morning: One book marked "Currently Reading" Clear, visual indicator showing the chosen book Sarah closing laptop with satisfaction Text from friend: "Love the pick! So easy!" "From chaos to decision in 48 hours, not 3 weeks"

## AI reply
Thanks for sharing the draft! Before I turn this into a structured micro-course, could you let me know:

1. What is the working title or internal name for this course?
2. Do you want this course to include interactive elements (like quizzes, input fields, drag/drop) or should it remain text-based for now?
3. How long should the course roughly be (e.g. minutes or number of cards/steps)?
4. Should I maintain a light narrative tone throughout (like the 'Sarah' example), or shift to more generalised instruction in parts?
5. Do you want me to include a challenge at the end or just a prompt-ready plan as the output?

Once I have this, I’ll structure it in Little Parrot’s format and tone.

## User reply
1. Build a valuable product: how to break down your idea for vibe coding.
2. It should include interactive elements like quizzes, input fields, potentially prompting.
3. The whole course should be made up of 8 challenges: What problem you're solving for your user, Who is your target user, Storyboard: From Struggle to Solution, Introducing story mapping, Map out  your solution: what the user does in your app, Carving out an MVP. Translate your map into clear building instructions for AI tools, Test with users right away. It should be less than 60 minutes.
4. There should be a mix of explaining the techniques (problem statement, persona, storyboard, story mapping, MVP), facilitating them to apply these techniques on their own product idea, and also guiding the user through these concepts with an example.
5. In the end, the user should walk away with a prompt template they can use to start building their product with Lovable.

## AI reply
Great, I’ll build a micro-course titled *Build a Valuable Product: How to Break Down Your Idea for Vibe Coding*. It will guide users through 8 challenges to help them clarify their problem, understand their user, map out the solution, and end with a prompt they can use to build with Lovable. I’ll include interactive elements and an ongoing example to keep things practical.

I’ll let you know when it’s ready. Feel free to keep chatting with me while I work on it!
