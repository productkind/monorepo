# Build a Valuable Product: Break Down Your Idea for AI "Vibe Coding"

Welcome to this micro-course! In the next 8 challenges, you'll learn how to take a product idea and
break it into manageable pieces – from defining the problem all the way to writing an AI prompt to
build an MVP (Minimum Viable Product). By the end, you’ll have a clear plan (and a prompt template) to
start building your product with AI tools like Lovable.

## Challenge 1: Define the Problem You’re Solving

**Why start with a problem statement?** Before jumping into solutions, it’s crucial to understand the
**user’s problem**. A clear problem statement serves as a guiding light for your project. It helps you and
your team stay focused on what users really need, rather than getting lost in features or technology. In
fact, a well-written problem statement can rally everyone around a common mission and build empathy
for the end user <sup>1</sup> . It also gives you a way to measure success – you succeed when the
problem is solved, not just when a product is launched <sup>2</sup> . By articulating the problem
(including its root cause and emotional impact on the user), you open the door to more creative and
effective solutions <sup>3</sup>.

**How to write a problem statement**: We’ll use a simple formula from design thinking <sup>4</sup>.
Fill in the blanks in this sentence to frame the problem from the user’s perspective:

*I am a [user persona] trying to [achieve a desired outcome], but [describe the barrier or problem] because
[explain the root cause of that barrier], which makes me feel [emotion].*<sup>5 6</sup>

This format forces you to clarify **who** has the problem, **what** they’re trying to do, **what’s blocking
them, why** that blockage exists, and **how it makes them feel**. Including the emotional aspect builds
empathy – it reminds us there’s a real person experiencing frustration, confusion, or other feelings due
to this problem.

**Example – Problem Statement:**

*I am a book club organizer trying to keep our monthly book club running smoothly and everyone engaged,
but our coordination is a complete mess – messages and book suggestions are scattered across WhatsApp
and email, because there’s no central place to organize everything (and group chats bury the important stuff
in off-topic messages), which makes me feel frustrated and exhausted, like I spend more time organizing than
enjoying the books.*

In the example above, notice how **specific** it is. We know exactly who the user is (a book club organizer),
what they want (an easy way to keep the club running and engaging), what the obstacles are (chaotic,
scattered communication), why those obstacles exist (no single tool or hub for coordination), and how it
makes the user feel (burned out and not having fun). A specific problem statement like this will guide us
to a more targeted solution. (If we simply said “organizing book clubs is hard,” we might build
something too generic or miss the real pain points.)

Now it’s your turn. Take a moment to craft a problem statement for **your** product idea using the
template. Don’t worry about getting it perfect on the first try – you can refine it as you learn more.

**INPUT:** Write your problem statement in the format above (persona, goal, barrier, cause, emotion).
Persona Example: `I am a busy parent...` (etc.)

## Challenge 2: Identify Your Target User (Persona)

Who are you building this product for? To design a great solution, you need a clear picture of the **target
user**. In product design, we often create a **persona** – a fictional yet realistic character representing our
typical user <sup>7</sup>. This persona is an **archetype** based on real user research or assumptions; it captures
the user's key characteristics, needs, frustrations, and goals.

A persona helps you **keep the user in mind** throughout development. Whenever you’re making a
decision, you can ask: *“Would this help [Persona’s Name] achieve their goals? What would [Persona] think of
this feature?”* It’s a way to build empathy and ensure you’re solving the right problems for the right
people <sup>7</sup>.

**How to create a simple persona**: You don’t need a 10-page biography. Focus on a few main points: -
**About**: Basic demographics or background relevant to your product. What is their situation or context? -
**Frustrations**: What pain points or problems do they encounter (especially related to the problem you
identified)? - **Goals**: What do they ultimately want to achieve? What does success or happiness look like
for them?

Fill in each of those for your persona. Give them a name and a descriptive title (e.g. “Sarah, the
overwhelmed book club organizer”), so they feel like a real person.

**Example – Persona:**

- **Persona: Sarah**, the overwhelmed book club organizer
- **About:** Sarah started a book club with her friends. She loves reading but has very limited free
  time. She’s not super tech-savvy; however, she’s comfortable with basic apps and willing to try
  simple digital tools to help manage the club.
- **Frustrations:** Sarah says things like *“I can't find the book suggestions in the chat history.”* The club’s
  coordination is chaos: *“We spend 30 minutes each meeting just figuring out what to read next.”*
  Often, *“half the group doesn’t vote because they miss the message,”* and she feels *“like a nag,
  constantly reminding people about deadlines.”* These quotes show her pain and annoyance with
  the current process.
- Goals: Sarah’s goals are clear. She wants to *spend no more than 10 minutes per month on book club
  admin tasks* (not hours digging through messages). She hopes to *get everyone to actually
  participate in choosing books* so it’s a group effort. She **never** wants to lose a good book
  suggestion again – every recommendation should be captured. Most of all, she wants to **keep the
  club fun** and not let organizing it turn into a chore.

This persona gives us a vivid understanding of our user. We can almost imagine Sarah using our
product – which features would make her life easier, and what would annoy her.

Now, define the persona for your product idea:

**INPUT:** Create your persona.<br>
Persona: *(e.g. “Sarah, the overwhelmed book club organizer”)*

**INPUT:** About: *(Who are they? Brief background and relevant details. e.g. “Started a book club with friends;
loves reading but has limited free time; not very technical.”)*

**INPUT:** Frustrations: *(What problems or annoyances do they face? e.g. “Can't find book suggestions in
scattered chats”; “spends 30 minutes every meeting choosing a book”; etc.)*

**INPUT:** Goals: *(What do they want to achieve? e.g. “Keep admin work under 10 minutes a month”; “get
everyone to participate”; “never lose a suggestion”; “make book club fun again.”)*

Take your time to fill these out. Your persona will guide a lot of decisions moving forward. Remember to
keep it **user-centered** – focus on their needs and feelings, not what technology they use or what
solution you have in mind (those come later!).

## Challenge 3: Storyboard – From Struggle to Solution

Now that you know **who** you’re designing for and **what** problem you need to solve, let’s visualize how
your solution will help your user. A great way to do this is by creating a **storyboard**. This is a series of
panels or sketches that illustrate the user’s journey: from experiencing the problem, to using your
solution, to reaching a happy outcome.

Think of it like a comic strip of your user’s story. Why storyboard? Because “seeing” the user’s
experience step by step helps you identify *what exactly your solution needs to do.* It highlights critical
moments that your product must address. Plus, it’s a fun, creative exercise to ensure you truly
empathize with your user’s experience.

**How to storyboard:** Follow these steps【Draft】: 1. **Start with the struggle.** Draw or describe a scene
showing your user **frustrated** with the current situation (before your solution exists). This should depict
the problem you wrote earlier.<br>
2. **Show the ending, solved.** Next, imagine the future **with** your solution: how is your user feeling and
what are they doing once the problem is resolved? Draw the **happy ending** – the user succeeding,
thanks to your product.<br>
3. **Map the journey.** Fill in 2-4 panels between the start and end, showing **how** the user gets from the
struggle to the solved state using your solution. Each panel is a key moment or interaction with your
product that helps overcome a part of the problem.

Even if you’re not an artist, simple sketches or stick figures are fine – the point is to capture the idea. If
drawing isn’t possible, you can also just write out what happens in each “panel” in words.

**Example – Storyboard for Sarah’s Book Club Solution:**

- **Panel 1 – The Struggle (😫):** *Scene:* Sarah is at her kitchen table late at night, looking **stressed**.
  She has her phone in hand with multiple chat apps open (WhatsApp, email), papers or sticky
  notes with book titles scattered around. There’s a coffee cup and maybe an aspirin bottle next to
  her – hinting at a headache. **Thought bubble:** “Did Jake suggest that mystery novel or was it
  Jamie? And which chat was it in?” She’s overwhelmed trying to track suggestions. *Caption:*
  “Another month, another chaotic book selection process.” (This panel illustrates the **pain**:
  disorganized communication and a frustrated Sarah.)
- **Panel 2 – The Happy Ending (😊):** *Scene:* Now Sarah is relaxed on her couch with a book in hand
  and a smile on her face. Her laptop is open on the coffee table showing a **clean list** of book
  suggestions on a simple app interface (our solution). Her phone is put aside (no frantic
  messaging needed). *Thought bubble:* “Everyone voted, we picked a great book, and it only took 2
  minutes!” She’s clearly happy and stress-free. *Caption:* “Book club is fun again – it practically runs
  itself!” (This panel shows the outcome when the problem is solved: Sarah enjoys reading,
  coordination is easy.)
- **Panels 3-6 – The Journey (🚀 How We Get There):** These panels show *how Sarah uses the product*
  to go from 😫 to 😊:
- **Panel 3 – Discovery & Setup (💡):** Sarah finds a new app and creates **“Sarah’s Book Club”** with
  one click. The screen says “Name your club” and she types it in. She looks cautiously optimistic.
  Thought: “Could it really be this simple?” (Key moment: easy setup, hope begins.)
- **Panel 4 – The First Magic (✨):** Sarah enters a few book suggestions into the app (it takes
  seconds). She shares a link with her friends. Her friend Emma immediately adds a suggestion
  too, which instantly appears. No logins or complicated steps – just a shared link. Sarah is
  pleasantly surprised. Sarah thinks: “Everyone can see everything in one place!” (Key moment:
  centralizing suggestions effortlessly.)
- **Panel 5 – Group Participation (👥):** Sarah checks the app later and sees 5 friends have joined and
  added 12 suggestions total! Each suggestion shows who added it. Sarah is amazed: *“They're
  actually participating! More suggestions in one day than in the last three months combined.”* (Key
  moment: the product successfully engages the whole group, solving the “people not
  participating” problem.)
- **Panel 6 – Decision & Peace (✅):** It’s Monday morning; the app shows one book marked as
  “Currently Reading” (clearly the chosen book). There’s a simple indicator highlighting the top-
  voted book. Sarah clicks “Finalize Selection.” She closes her laptop with satisfaction. She gets a
  text: “Love the pick! So easy!” from a club member. Sarah feels at peace. *Thought:* “From chaos to
  decision in 48 hours, not 3 weeks.” (Key moment: the solution dramatically speeds up and
  smooths out the decision process.)

Notice how each panel in the storyboard corresponds to a **feature or benefit** of the product: easy
setup, adding suggestions in one place, everyone contributing, quick voting/decision. By visualizing the
story, we’ve implicitly listed what our solution needs to do to make the happy ending happen.

**Reflect on your storyboard:** What are the key moments for your user? Even if you can’t draw right now,
imagine the **“before”** and **“after”** scenes for your user, and 2-4 steps in between where your product
helps them. This narrative will be the backbone of your solution.

*(If you have pen and paper, consider sketching your own 4-6 panel storyboard now! Stick figures and simple
labels are okay. If not, simply write down the sequence of moments from problem to solution, like we did for
Sarah.)*

**Explain:** A storyboard ensures everyone can **see the user’s journey**. It’s a powerful tool to
communicate your vision. You can share it with teammates or stakeholders to get them bought into the
problem and the solution approach. More importantly, it helps you identify what features or interactions
are truly needed. If a step is in your storyboard (e.g., “friends add suggestions easily”), then your
product must have that capability. In the next steps, we’ll take these moments and turn them into a
more formal plan for development.

---

### Challenge 4: Introducing Story Mapping

With a clear story in mind, it’s time to break down your solution into pieces that you can build. We’ll do
this with story mapping (also known as user-story mapping). Story mapping is a technique to outline
the user’s journey through your product in a structured way 8
. Think of it as taking the storyboard
moments and arranging them as a to-do list for your app.
In story mapping, you list all the actions a user needs to take to go from start to finish in your product.
These actions are often organized into levels: - Activities or Stages: The high-level phases of use (e.g.
“Set up account”, “Manage book suggestions”, “Choose a book” in Sarah’s case). - Steps or Tasks: Under
each activity, the specific things the user does (e.g. “Invite members” or “Add a book suggestion” or
“Vote on a suggestion”). - (Sometimes) Details/Sub-tasks: Smaller interactions needed for each step
(e.g. “Enter book title into form”, “Click vote button”).
You don’t need to worry about formal hierarchy too much for a simple project. The goal is to get all the
user actions out of your head and onto paper (or a screen). This will ensure you don’t forget
9
anything important the app must do, and it lets you see the big picture of your product.
Why do this? Story mapping helps with prioritization and planning. It visually lays out how the user
will navigate your app to achieve their goal 10
. It also makes it easier to spot which features are
core and which are nice-to-have (for later). Jeff Patton, who popularized story mapping, advocated it as
a replacement for long, dull requirement documents – instead of reading a spec, your team can literally
look at a map of the user’s interactions 9
. It sparks conversations and ensures everyone understands
how the pieces fit together.
Example – Story Map (excerpt for Sarah’s app):
Imagine a simple map for the book club app. It might start like this: - Activity 1: Set Up Club
- Step 1: Create a new club (enter name, get share link)
- Step 2: Invite friends (send them the link)
- Activity 2: Collect Suggestions
- Step 1: Add book suggestion (by organizer or members)
- Step 2: View all suggestions in list
- Activity 3: Decide on Book
- Step 1: Vote on suggestions (each member votes)
- Step 2: Display the top-voted book
- Step 3: Mark the chosen book as “current”
(This is a simplified example. Your real story map might have more steps or different structure based on
your product idea.)
The story map covers the whole end-to-end experience. By laying it out, we can clearly see what we
need to build.
In the next challenge, you will create a story map for your own product idea.

Challenge 5: Map Out Your Solution (User Story Map Exercise)
Now it’s your turn to outline what the user does in your app step by step. Use the understanding from
your storyboard and persona to enumerate the key actions. Don’t worry about how the app will
implement them (that comes later); focus on what the user needs to do and in what order.
Tips for story mapping your idea: - Start at the very beginning: How does a user first find or start
using your product? Do they sign up or just open an app? This is the first activity. - Then move through
the user’s journey: What’s the next major thing they do? And after that? Continue until the user’s main
goal (identified in your problem statement) is achieved. - Write each action as something the user does
(e.g. “user submits a book suggestion” or “user sets a reminder”). Avoid phrasing them as internal
system tasks. - Keep it high-level enough that you have maybe 5-15 steps in total. (If you have a lot
more, see if some can be grouped into a higher-level activity.)
It often helps to list steps in a numbered sequence (which implies the order of use). You can refine
grouping into activities later if needed.
INPUT: Outline the key steps a user will take to use your product and solve their problem. List them in
the order they would happen. You can number them or use bullets. (For example: “1. User creates a new
account... 2. User enters information about X... 3. User shares link with friend...” and so on.)
(Feel free to refer back to your storyboard or persona if you need to recall what needs to happen.)
After writing your steps, double-check: Does this cover the entire journey from the user’s
perspective? From the moment they encounter the problem to the point where it’s solved, every action
on your map should move the user forward. If something is unrelated to solving the main problem, it
might not need to be in this flow (at least not for the first version of your product).
Great! You now have a user story map – essentially a rough blueprint of features and interactions for
your app. The next step is deciding what to build first.
Challenge 6: Carving Out an MVP
Time to prioritize. You likely have more steps in your story map than you can (or should) build
immediately. Successful products often start small, with just the core functionality that delivers value –
this is your MVP (Minimum Viable Product).
What’s an MVP? It stands for Minimum Viable Product, meaning the simplest version of the product
that is usable and valuable to users 5
. It’s not a crappy, half-baked product or just a prototype you
slap together – it should be a complete loop that solves the primary problem, but with no extra bells
and whistles. Think of it as the “smallest possible piece” of your idea that still delivers the main value
11
. By keeping it minimal, you can build and launch faster, then learn from real users and iterate. As
one expert put it, “Think big, but act small: Build the smallest possible piece of functionality and ship it. Don’t
think MVP means poor quality – the ‘minimal’ means minimal features, not minimal effort or quality.”
11
Why build only an MVP first? There are many benefits: - Speed and focus: With fewer features, you
can develop and launch quickly. This means you get your solution into users’ hands sooner. - User
feedback: An MVP allows you to test your assumptions. You can find out early if you’re solving the right
6
problem. If not, you can pivot or adjust with less wasted work. - Resource savings: You avoid spending
time and money on features that users don’t actually need or want. Build the core that matters most,
and save the “nice-to-haves” for later. - Clarity: For you and your team, an MVP forces clarity on what’s
truly essential. It’s easy to get caught up thinking everything is important. But when you constrain
scope, you make tough choices about what will have the biggest impact on the user’s problem.
Quiz: Which statement about an MVP is TRUE?
A. An MVP is a prototype with every feature, just not polished.
B. An MVP is the smallest version of the product that still delivers core value to the user.
C. An MVP should be of low quality since it’s only a test version.
D. An MVP is the same as the final product’s first full release (just version 1.0).
(Think about it... The correct answer is the one that aligns with solving the user’s main problem with minimal
features, not compromising on solving the problem or on quality.)
Now, look at your story map from Challenge 5. Which steps or features are absolutely necessary to
solve the user’s primary problem? Those are your MVP. The rest can likely wait for later versions.
Often, the MVP is a subset of your story map – maybe the first one or two activities, or even just a single
core workflow – while other nice features are left out initially.
Example – MVP for Sarah’s App: From the story map we listed, what’s the minimal product that still
makes book club organizing easier? Probably: - The ability to add and view book suggestions in one
central list. - A way for members to vote or indicate preference on suggestions. - Showing which
book is selected (maybe automatically the top vote-getter, or manually marked by organizer).
These three things alone would directly address Sarah’s biggest pain: scattered suggestions and chaotic
voting. We can exclude features like user profiles, notifications, discussion forums, etc., in the first
version. Those aren’t strictly needed to solve the immediate problem (though they might be nice later).
The MVP is laser-focused on suggestions + voting + result.
Your turn – define your MVP:
INPUT: From your story map, list the features or steps that will be in your MVP. In other words, what
are the must-haves to solve the core problem? (You can list them as bullet points or a short paragraph.
e.g. “MVP will include: a central suggestion board, a voting mechanism, and a result display. Other features
like comments or reminders will be added later.”)
By articulating your MVP, you’ve made a critical decision: you know what to build first. This will keep
you focused when you start actually building with AI. It’s tempting to add more, but remember the
principle: maximize value by building the smallest possible piece that works. You can always expand later
after testing your MVP.
Challenge 7: Write Clear Prompts to Build with AI (Vibe Coding)
You have a plan – problem, persona, story, map, MVP – now it’s time to turn this plan into reality.
Uniquely, we’re going to use an AI development tool (Lovable) to build our app by writing prompts
instead of manual coding. This approach is sometimes nicknamed “vibe coding” – you describe the
vibe or behavior of the app you want, and the AI assembles the code for you.
7
But to get the best results, you must communicate clearly with the AI. Think of it as giving
instructions to a really smart (but literal) junior developer. If your instructions (prompts) are vague or
too broad, you might get something unexpected. We’ll cover how to structure your prompts and a
strategy to build iteratively.
How to structure prompts for an AI builder: 1. Start with a high-level overview: Your first prompt
should paint the big picture of your app. Include the type of app, the main user or persona, and the
primary goal or use case. Essentially, summarize your problem statement in instructive form. (E.g.
“Build a simple web app for a book club organizer to collect book suggestions and votes from
members.”) 2. List core features (MVP): Still in the initial prompt, mention the key features you
outlined as MVP. Be specific but concise. (E.g. “It should have a page where members can add new book
suggestions, a voting feature for those suggestions, and a way to display the top-voted book of the
month.”) 3. Provide any essential details or constraints: If you have preferences about the design or
tech, you can add (though if not, the AI will choose defaults). For example, “Make the interface very
simple and user-friendly, with clear buttons for adding suggestions and voting.” Or “Use a friendly tone,
maybe a book theme in the UI.” You could also specify platforms (“as a web app viewable on mobile and
desktop”). 4. Use clear, structured language: Write prompts in numbered steps or bullet points if
needed, to break down tasks. The AI often handles step-by-step instructions well. Avoid ambiguity –
e.g., instead of “make it like Facebook but for books,” say “create a homepage listing current book, with
a form to submit new books.” 5. Iterate incrementally: Don’t expect to get everything perfect in one
giant prompt. It’s usually better to build in pieces. For example, you might first prompt for the basic UI
and functionality. Then once the base app is generated, you might give a second prompt like “Add a
login page for members” or “Connect to a database to save suggestions” or “Improve the styling with a
cozy book-club theme.” Each prompt refines or extends the app. This step-by-step approach (adding
one feature at a time) aligns with how AI “vibe coding” works best 12
– it allows you to check results
and adjust as you go. 6. Be prepared to refine: If the AI output isn’t exactly what you want, you can
prompt again with adjustments. E.g. “The voting feature is confusing; please change it so each user can
only vote once and show a vote count.” The key is to be specific about what to change.
Best Practices: According to experts, successful AI builders often use clear and structured prompts
and start with small incremental tasks 12
. So don’t feel you have to describe your entire app in one
paragraph. You can break it down.
Prompt Template: Here’s a template you can use as a starting point for your first prompt to Lovable (or
a similar AI dev tool):
“Build a [platform/type of application] for [user/persona]. The app should [overall purpose or goal]. It needs to
include the following features: [feature 1], [feature 2], [feature 3] (…etc, list your MVP features). Make the
design [any style preferences: simple, modern, themed…] and ensure it’s easy for the user to [key action].”
For example, using Sarah’s case, a prompt might be:
“Build a web app for a book club organizer to streamline book selection. It should allow multiple
users (club members) to submit book suggestions, display all suggestions in a list, and let users
vote on their favorite suggestion. After voting, the app should show which book is selected as the
book of the month. Make the interface clean and user-friendly, with a book club theme (maybe a small
book icon and warm colors). Ensure it’s easy to use for non-technical people.”
This prompt gives context (who it’s for and why) and specifics (what it should do). From here, the AI
would generate an initial version of the app. Then we could refine with additional prompts (e.g., “Add an
8
email invite feature” or “Make the voting results only visible to the organizer” or whatever we need next,
based on testing).
Now it’s your turn to craft the prompt for your product:
INPUT: Draft your first AI building prompt for your app. Include the app’s purpose, the target user, and
the MVP features you listed. (You can follow the template above. Don’t worry, you can adjust it later –
this is a starting point.)
Once you have this prompt, congratulations! You essentially have the blueprint to hand over to an AI like
Lovable to start building your product. In fact, Lovable’s own documentation emphasizes using a clear
description and then refining in chat as needed 12
, so you’re on the right track.
Pro-tip: When you actually use the AI tool, remember to go step-by-step. After the initial build, test what
you have, then use follow-up prompts to add the next most important feature, fix something that isn’t
right, or polish the design. This iterative cycle is how you co-create with AI effectively.
Challenge 8: Test with Users Right Away
You’ve defined the problem, designed a solution, and even built a first version (in theory). What’s next?
Testing with real users! The whole point of an MVP is to get it in front of people and learn. This final
step is about validating your idea and gathering feedback as early as possible.
Why test now? Because no matter how well you’ve thought through the problem, real users will
surprise you. They might use the product in unexpected ways, or they might still have unmet needs.
Early user testing helps you catch these things before you invest too much in building more. As the
Lean Startup mantra goes: you want to “build – measure – learn” in quick cycles.
In practice, “testing” could be as simple as showing your prototype/MVP to a few target users
(maybe colleagues, friends, or friendly potential customers who fit your persona) and asking them to
use it. Observe where they get confused or frustrated, and ask for their impressions: Did it solve your
problem? What did you like or not like? Sometimes even one customer using it will give you a wealth of
insight – “we can do all the research and prototyping in the world, but nothing beats that first customer
13
trying the product” .
For Sarah’s book club app, testing might involve asking a couple of book club organizers to try
coordinating their next pick with the app. Their feedback (e.g., “It was great except I wish I could notify
people in-app rather than separately”) would directly inform what to build next (maybe notifications
become a priority).
Plan your user test: Think about who could give you honest feedback on your product idea. Ideally,
someone who matches your persona or at least has the problem you’re solving. It could be a friend, a
co-worker, or a small group of potential users. You don’t need a fully polished product to start testing –
even a clickable mockup or the early version from Lovable is fine.
And remember, testing isn’t a one-time thing. It’s a mindset of continually learning and improving. After
your first test, you might go back to your prompt, refine the app, then test again with more users or
more features.
9
INPUT: Who will you test your MVP with, and how? Write down a quick plan (even if it’s just “I’ll share the
app link with two colleagues who also run book clubs and ask for their feedback on ease of use and if it
solves their coordination issues”).
(Example: “I will invite my friend (who is my target user persona) to use the app for her next book club
meeting. I’ll watch how she adds suggestions and votes, and interview her afterwards about what was easy or
hard. If something frustrates her or if she still falls back to WhatsApp, that’s a sign I need to improve that
part.”)
By planning this out, you commit to actually getting real-world input. This is where your product
becomes truly valuable – when it’s in the hands of users and making their lives better. Testing early and
often is the key to building something people love (and it saves you from building the wrong thing).
Conclusion & Next Steps
Congratulations on working through the process! You started with a raw idea and ended with: - A well-
defined problem statement (so you know exactly what you’re solving). - A clear persona (so you know
who you’re solving it for). - A visualized storyboard of the user journey (so you understand how your
solution fits into their life). - A detailed story map of features and steps (your feature roadmap). - A
scoped-down MVP plan (your immediate build target). - A crafted AI prompt to start building your
product in Lovable (your development instructions). - A plan to test with users and get feedback right
away.
You now have a prompt template and a clear plan to go from idea to app using AI-assisted
development. The only thing left is to put it into action: enter that prompt into Lovable (or your AI tool
of choice), build your MVP, and let users try it. From there, use what you learn to iterate and improve.
By breaking the process into these steps, you’ve made a daunting task (building a product) much more
manageable. This is the same approach experienced product designers and founders use – the
difference is you have the power of AI to accelerate the building part. Remember to keep the user’s
problem at the heart of everything you do, and you’ll be on the right track to a valuable, lovable
product!
Good luck, and happy building!
