concepts:
  - name: ['AI', 'Artificial Intelligence']
    what: |
      Artificial Intelligence refers to an ability of a machine to perform tasks that typically
      require human intelligence. This includes learning, comprehension, reasoning,
      problem-solving, perception, language understanding, and more.
    why: |
      There are many problems that are too complex to be solved by traditional programming
      techniques. AI provides a way to tackle these problems, and help automate tasks that
      would otherwise require human intervention.
    when:
      - 'Chatbots that can understand and respond to human queries.'
      - 'Image recognition systems that can identify objects in photos.'
      - 'Recommendation systems that suggest products based on user preferences.'
    like: null
    levelRange: [1, 1]
  - name: ['AI Model', 'Model']
    what: |
      An AI Model is a program that has been trained on a set of data to perform specific tasks
      such as recognise patterns, make decisions, prediction, or generate content.
    why: null
    when:
      - 'A neural network trained to classify images into categories.'
      - "OpenAI's GPT 4o"
      - "Claude 4 sonnet"
    like: |
      You can think of an AI model as the recipe for pizza. The input is the ingredients
      (data), the model is the recipe (algorithm), and the output is the pizza (predictions or
      results). The recipe of pizza was created through a process of using the recipe then changing
      its parameters to improve the taste of the pizza (training). I has changed a lot over time
      from the first roman bread with toppings to the modern pizza we know today.
    levelRange: [1, 3]
  - name: ['Model Training', 'Training']
    what: |
      Training a model involves feeding an algorithm with data that adjusts the model's internal
      parameters to improve its performance on a specific task.
    why: |
      Compared to traditional programming, where rules are explicitly defined, training
      allows models to learn from data and adapt to new information, making them more flexible
      and capable of handling complex tasks.
    when: null
    like: |
      Training the model is how the recipe is changed to improve the taste of the pizza after
      every time it is made. The more you make the pizza, the better the recipe becomes.
  - name: 'Parameter'
    what: |
      Parameters are the internal variables of a model that are set during training. They are
      adjusted to minimize the error in the model's predictions.
    when: null
    like: |
      Parameters are like the processing steps in a recipe.
  - name: ['LLM', 'Large Language Model']
    what: |
      A Large Language Model is a type of AI model that has been trained on vast amounts of text
      data to understand and generate human language.
    when:
      - "OpenAI's GPT 4o"
      - "Google's Gemini"
      - "Meta's LLaMA"
    like: null
  - name: 'Prompt'
    what: |
      A prompt is an input piece of text given to an AI model to receive a specific output.
    when:
      - 'What is the capital of France?'
      - 'Write a poem about the sea.'
    like: |
      In our pizza analogy, a prompt is the ingredients you provide to the recipe. The better
      the ingredients, the better the pizza will turn out.
  - name: 'Token'
    what: |
      A token is a unit of text that the model processes. It can be a word, part of a word, or
      even punctuation.
    when:
      - 'In natural language processing, a token could be a word or punctuation mark.'
      - 'In programming, a token could be a keyword, identifier, or operator.'
    like: |
      Tokens are like the individual ingredients in our pizza recipe. Each ingredient contributes
      to the overall flavor of the pizza.

      - AI
    aspect:
      Current AI solutions are based on machine learning particularly deep learning techniques.
  - name: 'Model Input and Output'
    level: 1
    related_concepts:
      - Model
    aspect:
      Always has an input and an output.
  - name: 'Model Input and Output Types'
    level: 1
    related_concepts:
      - Model
    aspect:
      The input and output types of a model can vary widely depending on the task it is designed
      to perform. For example, a model for image recognition might take an image as input and
      output a label or a set of labels, while a model for text generation might take a prompt
      as input and output a generated text.
  - name: 'Model Training'
    level: 1
    related_concepts:
      - Model
      - Training
    aspect:
      Models are created through a process called training, where they learn from a large dataset
      to improve their performance on a specific task.
  - name: 'LLMs are not thinking'
    level: 1
    related_concepts:
      - LLM
    aspect:
      LLMs do not think or understand in the way humans do. They just follow the statistical
      patterns they have learned from the data they were trained on. They are just always
      predicting the most probable next token based on the previous tokens in the input.
