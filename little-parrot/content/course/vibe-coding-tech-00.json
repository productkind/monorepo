You can point your AI app builder to exactly the right place.\n\n✓ **You speak design language:** Wireframes, components, colours, fonts. You can describe exactly what you're picturing, no more \"make it nicer.\"\n\n✓ **You know what's under the hood:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript. You can give meaningful feedback to your AI app builder and ask better questions.\n\n✓ **You can prompt for backend features:** APIs, authentication, backend functions. You've graduated from pretty interfaces to powerful, functional products.\n\n✓ **You understand data:** Tables, relationships, SQL. You can think about how your app remembers things and ask the right questions.\n\n✓ **You know the danger zones:** Irreversible database changes, exposed API keys. You can protect yourself from common mistakes that trip up beginners.\n\n✓ **You share a vocabulary with developers:** Collaboration just got so much easier. You're no longer on the outside looking in.\n\nTools will change, but these foundations won't. The more you practise describing what you want in this language, the more powerful your vibe coding becomes.\n\n**Remember:** Start small, describe clearly, ship often, and learn from real users. You've built a superpower. Now go use it! 💪"
