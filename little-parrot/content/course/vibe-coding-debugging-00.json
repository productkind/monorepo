The team taped the insect into the logbook and wrote that they had **“debugged”** the machine.\n\nToday, bugs are simply **mismatches between what you expected and what actually happens.**",

A debugging session that costs a few credits is incredibly cost-effective!\n\nDon't let credit concerns stop you from proper testing and investigation.
