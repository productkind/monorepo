The team taped the insect into the logbook and wrote that they had **“debugged”** the machine.\n\nToday, bugs are simply **mismatches between what you expected and what actually happens.**",

If you don't understand the problem, your fix might not work, or might break something else.\n\nThis is true for vibe coding too!
