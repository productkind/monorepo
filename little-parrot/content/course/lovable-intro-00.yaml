              A dalmatian dog (called Dalmie) wearing a red shirt sits with her friend Sarah at a
              café table. Sarah looks frustrated, phone in hand. Sarah says, "Our book club is such
              a mess! Suggestions get lost in WhatsApp, and nobody knows what we're reading next."

              What if you could build a real app, not a mockup, not a prototype, but actual working
              software, just by describing what you want? That's exactly what you're about to do.
              In this micro-course, you'll learn vibe coding: a way of building apps by explaining
              what you want in plain English. No coding required. You'll write your first structured
              prompt, see Lovable turn it into a working app, and learn to add features one step at
              a time. By the end, you'll have a published app live on the internet that you can share
              with anyone. Along the way, you'll discover Lovable's interface, learn to experiment
              safely with bookmarks and reverts, and understand when to tweak versus when to start
              fresh. Ready to build something real? Let's go!

            body: |-
              **Vibe coding** is a way of building software by describing what you want instead of writing code. You explain how the app should look, feel, and behave, and an AI tool like Lovable translates your words into a working product.

              It's called "vibe coding" because you're communicating the vibe of what you want, not the technical details. The AI handles the technical bits.

              Lovable builds **web applications**, meaning software that runs in a browser on phones, tablets, and computers. Think of apps like Notion, Trello, or Google Docs. These are all web apps.

              *Fun fact:* Little Parrot (the platform you are using right now) was built with Lovable.

          content:
            body: |-
              Here's something important: **vague prompts get vague results**.

              If you tell Lovable `make me an app for my book club,` you'll get something generic. It might work, but it probably won't match what you imagined.

              The secret to getting closer to what you want on the first try? A **structured prompt**.

          title: The prompt formula
          content:
            body: |-
              This formula helps you describe your app clearly:

              ```markdown
              ## Product overview
              [What is this app? What problem does it solve?]

              ## User flow
              [What does the user do, step by step?]

              ## Platform requirements
              - Mobile-first layout
              - Accessible (WCAG AA compliance)

              ## Design system
              - Brand colours
              - Fonts
              - Style

              ## Implementation details
              [Any specific technical requirements]

              ## Target user
              [Who is this app for?]
              ```

              Don't worry if you don't know what to put in every section yet. You can start simple and add detail later. The structure itself helps Lovable understand what you're after.

              Here's a mindset that will save you time and frustration: **don't try to build everything at once**.

              It's tempting to describe your entire vision in one big prompt. But this often backfires. Lovable might misunderstand part of it, or build things in a way that you envisioned differently. You end up spending more effort fixing than you would have spent building step by step.

              Instead, start with one core user flow. Get that working. Then add the next piece.

              Dalmie's friend Sarah runs a book club, but coordination is a nightmare. Messages are scattered across WhatsApp, book suggestions get lost, and they spend more time figuring out logistics than actually reading.

              Dalmie wants to help. Her full vision includes suggesting books, voting, tracking what they're reading, and more. But for her first prompt, she focuses on just one thing: **a place to collect book suggestions**.

              ## Product overview
              A simple app where book club members can suggest books for the group to read next.

              ## User flow
              1. User opens the app and sees a list of book suggestions
              2. User can add a new suggestion with the book title and a short note about why they recommend it

              ## Platform requirements

              - Accessible (WCAG AA compliance)

              Notice what Dalmie left out: voting, deadlines, current book tracking, organiser controls. Those will come later.

              Right now, she just wants to see if Lovable can create a clean list where people can add suggestions. One thing at a time.

              This approach means if something goes wrong, she knows exactly what caused it. And she stays in control of how her app grows.

            options:
              - It's cheaper
              - Big prompts are not allowed
              - If something goes wrong, you know what caused it and can fix it easily
              - Lovable can only build one feature at a time
            correctAnswer: 2
            explanation: Building one feature at a time means problems are easier to spot and fix. You stay in control of how your app grows, instead of untangling a complex mess.

            body: |-
              You might be wondering: why didn't we include voting, deadlines, and everything else in the first prompt? Wouldn't it be faster to describe it all at once?

              Here's what actually happens when you try that:
              - Lovable might misunderstand one part, and that mistake ripples through everything else
              - You get a complex app that's harder to understand and fix
              - You spend more time untangling problems than you saved by combining prompts

            body: |-
              Building one feature at a time means:
              - You can test each piece before adding the next
              - Problems are easier to spot and fix
              - You stay in control of how your app grows

              This also helps with credits. Lovable uses credits based on the complexity of your request. A detailed, focused prompt often uses fewer credits than a vague mega-prompt followed by lots of fixes.

              Here's a freeing thought: **it's cheap to start over**.

              If Lovable creates something that's 70% right but the 30% that's wrong is fundamental, don't spend hours trying to fix it. Just start fresh with a better prompt.

              This might feel wasteful if you're used to thinking about code as precious. But in vibe coding, your prompt is the valuable thing, not the output. A clearer prompt will give you a cleaner result.

            body: |-
              **Tweak** when the structure is right but details need adjusting. For example:
              - The button colour is wrong
              - The text needs editing
              - The spacing looks off

              **Start fresh** when the fundamental approach is wrong. For example:
              - The layout doesn't match what you imagined
              - The app flow is confusing
              - Lovable built something completely different from what you described

              Dalmie's app can now collect book suggestions. Time for the next piece: letting Sarah and her friends vote.

              Here's Dalmie's follow-up prompt:

              ```
              Add a voting feature. Each club member can vote for one book from the suggestions. Show vote counts next to each book. Highlight the book with the most votes.
              ```

              See how specific that is? She's not saying "make voting work." She's describing exactly what voting means for this app: one vote per person, visible counts, and a clear winner.

              - Reading deadlines

              Here's the truth about building apps: things will break. You'll try something and it won't work. This is normal. What matters is knowing how to recover.

              Lovable has tools that make experimentation safe. Let's learn how to use them.

              Good news: Lovable automatically saves every version of your app. You can't accidentally lose everything with an errant click.

              Every time you make a change, Lovable keeps a record. This history is your safety net.

              Before you try something risky (like a big structural change), bookmark your current version. It's like saving your game before a boss fight.

              Look for the bookmark icon in the version history. Give it a name you'll recognise, like "Working version before adding login."

              If things go wrong, you can always return to this bookmark.

              If something goes wrong, you can go back to any previous version. Open the version history, find the version you want, and restore it.

              **When to revert:**
              - The change broke something fundamental
              - You created a mess you can't easily untangle

              **When to fix instead:**
              - It's a small issue

              For complex features, you can ask Lovable to plan before building. This is helpful when you're not quite sure how something should work.

              Enable planning mode and describe what you want. Lovable will outline an approach and check with you before writing code.

              A word of caution: **Lovable works best when you build as you go**.

              Planning too far ahead leads to what's called "context rot," meaning the plan becomes outdated as you learn what actually works.

              Plan one feature at a time, not your entire product roadmap. Build, test, learn, then plan the next thing.

              You can give Lovable documents to reference, like brand guidelines, product requirements, or examples of what you like.

              Upload them as knowledge files, and Lovable can refer to them when building. This is useful when you want consistent styling or behaviour across your app.

              If you want to connect your app to other services (like sending emails or processing payments), you'll need API keys. These are like passwords that let your app talk to other services.

              **Never put API keys in your prompts.** Lovable has a dedicated secrets panel for storing them safely. Look for it in the settings.

              Lovable Cloud handles backend features like user accounts and data storage without you needing to set up servers.

              For most apps, it's the simplest way to add these capabilities. When you need features that require saving data or managing users, Lovable Cloud makes it straightforward.

              Read what Lovable suggests and follow its guidance. Usually it's something straightforward, like making sure certain data isn't publicly accessible.

            correctAnswer: 1
