              A dalmatian dog (called Dalmie) wearing a red shirt sits with her friend Sarah at a
              café table. Sarah looks frustrated, phone in hand. Sarah says, "Our book club is such
              a mess! Suggestions get lost in WhatsApp, and nobody knows what we're reading next."

              You have an idea for an app. Maybe it's something to help your community, your
              business, or just solve a problem that's been bugging you. But you don't know how
              to code, so that idea stays stuck in your head.
              What if that changed today? What if you could describe what you want and watch it
              become real software, live on the internet, that you can share with anyone?
              That's exactly what's about to happen. By the end of this micro-course, you'll go
              from "I can't build apps" to "I just published my first one." You'll know how to
              turn ideas into working products by describing what you want. No coding required.
              Along the way, you'll learn to build step by step, handle problems calmly, and
              experiment without fear of breaking things.
              Ready to become someone who builds? Let's go!

          content:
            body: |-
              **Vibe coding** is a way of building software by describing what you want instead of writing code. You explain how the app should look, feel, and behave, and an AI tool like Lovable translates your words into a working product.

              It's called "vibe coding" because you're communicating the vibe of what you want, not the technical details. The AI handles the technical bits.

            body: |-
              Lovable builds **web applications**, meaning software that runs in a browser on phones, tablets, and computers. Think of apps like Notion, Trello, or Google Docs. These are all web apps if you open them in a browser.

              *Fun fact:* Little Parrot (the platform you are using right now) was built with Lovable.

          content:
            body: |-
              Here's something important: **vague prompts get vague results**.

              If you tell Lovable `make me an app for my book club,` you'll get something generic. It might work, but it probably won't match what you imagined.

              The secret to getting closer to what you want on the first try? A **structured prompt**.

          title: The prompt formula
          content:
            body: |-
              This formula helps you describe your app clearly:

              ```markdown
              ## Product overview
              [What is this app? What problem does it solve?]

              ## User flow
              [What does the user do, step by step?]

              ## Platform requirements
              - Mobile-first layout
              - Accessible (WCAG AA compliance)

              ## Design system
              - Brand colours
              - Fonts
              - Style

              ## Implementation details
              [Any specific technical requirements]

              ## Target user
              [Who is this app for?]
              ```

              Don't worry if you don't know what to put in every section yet. You can start simple and add detail later. The structure itself helps Lovable understand what you're after.
          subtitle: A structure that works
        - type: text
          title: What's with all those symbols?
          content:
            body: |-
              The prompt formula uses **markdown**, a simple way to format text that AI tools understand well.

              Here's what the symbols mean:
              - `##` creates a heading (like a section title)
              - `-` creates a bullet point
              - `**text**` makes text bold
              - `1. 2. 3.` creates a numbered list

              You don't need to memorise this. Just copy the formula and fill in the brackets with your own content. The formatting helps Lovable see the structure of your request clearly.

              Here's a mindset that will save you time and frustration: **don't try to build everything at once**.

              It's tempting to describe your entire vision in one big prompt. But this often backfires. Lovable might misunderstand part of it, or build things in a way that you envisioned differently. You end up spending more effort fixing than you would have spent building step by step.

              Instead, start with one core user flow. Get that working. Then add the next piece.

              Dalmie's friend Sarah runs a book club, but coordination is a nightmare. Messages are scattered across WhatsApp, book suggestions get lost, and they spend more time figuring out logistics than actually reading.

              Dalmie wants to help. Her full vision includes suggesting books, voting, tracking what they're reading, and more. But for her first prompt, she focuses on just one thing: **a place to collect book suggestions**.

              ```markdown
              ## Product overview
              A simple app where book club members can suggest books for the group to read next.

              ## User flow
              1. User opens the app and sees a list of book suggestions
              2. User can add a new suggestion with the book title and a short note about why they recommend it

              ## Platform requirements
              - Mobile-first layout
              - Accessible (WCAG AA compliance)

              ## Design system
              - Brand colours: warm cream (#FDF6E3), deep brown (#5C4033), coral (#E07A5F)

              - Store data locally for now

              ## Target user
              Sarah, a book club organiser who wants to spend less time on admin and more time reading with friends.

              Notice **what Dalmie left out:** voting, deadlines, current book tracking, organiser controls. Those will come later.

              Right now, she just wants to see Lovable create a clean list where people can add suggestions. **One thing at a time.**

              This approach means if something goes wrong, she knows exactly what caused it. And she **stays in control** of how her app grows.

            question: Why do structured prompts work better than vague ones?
            options:
              - They use fewer credits
              - They help Lovable understand exactly what you want
              - They make the app you're building run faster
              - They look more professional
            correctAnswer: 1
            explanation: Research shows that AI works better with structured prompts. When you clearly lay out what you’re building – using markdown formatting, numbered lists – Lovable is less likely to misunderstand you, which saves time and gets you better results sooner.

          title: 'Quiz: Starting small'
          content:
            question: Why should you start with one core user flow instead of describing everything at once?
            options:
              - It's cheaper, and I really don't want to spend too many credits
              - Big prompts are not allowed
              - If something goes wrong, you know what caused it and can fix it easily
              - Lovable can only build one feature at a time
            correctAnswer: 2
            explanation: When you build one feature at a time, you can quickly spot anything that’s off, whether it’s something you didn’t ask for, something you don’t like, or something that doesn’t work properly. It keeps things manageable and puts you in control of how your app develops.

              You might be wondering: why didn't we include voting, deadlines, and everything else in the first prompt? **Wouldn't it be faster to describe it all at once?**

              Here's **what actually happens** when you try that:
              - Lovable might misunderstand one part, and that mistake ripples through everything else
              - It might build something that you didn't quite imagine
              - You get a complex app that's harder to understand and fix
              - You spend more time untangling problems than you saved by combining prompts

          content:
            body: |-
              Building **one feature at a time** means:
              - You can test each piece before adding the next
              - Problems are easier to spot and fix
              - You stay in control of how your app grows

              **This also helps with credits.** Lovable uses credits based on the complexity of your request. A detailed, focused prompt often uses fewer credits than a mega-prompt followed by lots of fixes.

              Here’s a freeing thought: **starting over is often cheap**, especially early on.
              
              After your first few prompts, **pause and take a look** at what Lovable has built. If something fundamental feels off, it’s usually faster to start again with a clearer prompt than to keep fixing it.

              This doesn’t mean you should throw everything away after weeks of work. But in the early stages, restarting can save time and frustration.

              **Tweak** when the structure is right but details need adjusting. For example:
              - The button colour is wrong
              - The text needs editing
              - The spacing looks off

              **Start fresh** when the fundamental approach is wrong. For example:
              - The layout doesn't match what you imagined
              - The app flow is confusing
              - Lovable built something completely different from what you described

            body: |-
              Right now, Dalmie's app stores data locally in the browser. That means if Sarah closes the tab or uses a different device, all the book suggestions disappear.

              For a real app that multiple people can use, you need a **backend**: a place to store data that everyone can access.

              **Why do this early?** Adding a backend later, after you've built lots of features, often causes problems. Things that worked locally might break when connected to real storage. It's much easier to set this up now, while your app is still simple.

              **Lovable Cloud** takes care of the behind-the-scenes work your app needs. It gives your app:
              - **Data storage:** Save book suggestions, votes, and anything else so they persist
              - **User accounts:** Let people create an account and sign in
              - **Shared access:** Multiple people can use the same app and see the same data
              - **Connections to other services:** Send emails, process payments, and more

              For most apps, Lovable Cloud is the simplest way to add these capabilities.

              To connect your app to Lovable Cloud, you can simply prompt Lovable:

              ```
              Connect this app to Lovable Cloud so that data is saved and accessible from any device.
              ```

              Lovable will set up the backend for you. After this, any data your app creates will be stored properly.

              You only need to do this once. From now on, new features you add will automatically use the backend.

              When Lovable needs to change how your data is stored, it will ask for your permission first. You'll see a **Modify database** message showing exactly what Lovable plans to do, like creating a new table for book suggestions or adding a column for votes.

              **This is normal and expected.** Lovable is being careful with your data. Simply review what it wants to do and click to **allow** the changes.

              You don't need to understand every detail. The key thing is that Lovable won't modify your database without checking with you first. This keeps you in control of what's happening with your app's data.

              *If you're curious about what databases are and how they work, our [Basics of Software for Vibe Coding](https://littleparrot.app/4794366d-b807-4804-8fd5-64c3a5a03472/course-overview) micro-course explains these concepts in friendly terms.*

              Sometimes errors happen when connecting to Lovable Cloud or making changes to your app. Don't worry, this is a normal part of building.

              If you see an error, look for the **Try to fix** button. Clicking it tells Lovable to attempt an automatic repair. This often resolves the issue quickly.

              If the error persists or there's no "Try to fix" button, you'll need to investigate further. Debugging is a skill that every builder develops over time.

              With Lovable Cloud connected, Dalmie wants to add voting. But wait, if anyone can vote without logging in, how would the app know who voted? Someone could vote multiple times.

              **Before building a feature, ask yourself: what does this feature need to work properly?**

              For voting, Dalmie needs users to log in first. That way, the app knows who each person is and can ensure everyone only votes once.

              Dalmie adds **Google Authentication** so book club members can log in:

              ```
              Add Google Authentication. Users should be able to sign in with their Google account. Show a "Sign in" button in the header. Once signed in, show their name and a "Sign out" button instead.
              ```

              Lovable Cloud makes this straightforward. After this prompt, users can **log in**, and the app will know who they are.

              *Try it for your app! Adding authentication is a common prerequisite for many features.*

              ```

              Because users are logged in, the app knows who voted and can prevent duplicate votes.

              After adding a feature, take a moment to verify it works as expected. For the voting feature, Dalmie tests:

              1. **Try voting without logging in.** The app should prevent this or prompt to sign in.
              2. **Log in and vote.** The vote count should update.
              3. **Try voting again on the same book.** The app should prevent duplicate votes.
              4. **Check with another user.** Open the app in a different browser or incognito window, log in as someone else, and confirm the votes are visible.

              This quick check catches problems early. Get into the habit of testing each feature before moving on to the next.

          content:
            question: Why is it better to connect Lovable Cloud early rather than waiting until later?
            options:
              - It costs fewer credits to set up early
              - Lovable requires it before you can add more features
              - It makes your app run faster
              - You'll have to redo and retest already built features
            correctAnswer: 3
            explanation: If you wait to connect Lovable Cloud – the system that saves and manages data – until after you’ve built most of the screens, you’ll probably have to redo a lot of work later, as the structure of your app changed. You'll also need to retest everything you've built up to that point to make sure everything still works.

              **Plan mode** in Lovable is a way to think, explore, and map out your ideas before any code is changed or written. It’s like having a helpful partner who talks through your problem, compares options, investigates bugs, and helps you choose the best approach before you build anything.

              Planning too far ahead leads to what's called "context rot." 
              
              **Context rot** is what happens when an AI model starts to get worse at using everything you’ve already told it because the conversation or input has become too long or cluttered. Even though the earlier information is still technically there, the model begins to ignore, forget, or misinterpret those details, leading to less accurate or confused responses.

              You can use it to store things like your user personas, design rules, naming conventions, and other guidelines. This makes the AI’s responses more relevant and consistent with your project’s needs.

              *If you want to know more about using API keys and connecting to other services, check out our [Basics of Software for Vibe Coding](https://littleparrot.app/4794366d-b807-4804-8fd5-64c3a5a03472/course-overview) micro-course.*

          title: Handling security errors and warnings
          content:
            body: |-
              Sometimes Lovable will flag security issues before you publish. Don't panic. This is normal and helpful. Developers deal with security considerations all the time.

              Check the security errors and warnings in the **Security** panel, and click "Try to fix all". Usually Lovable takes care of all issues, like making sure certain data isn't publicly accessible.

              It can happen that new warnings appear after fixing others. As long as you don't have any security errors, you are good to publish your app.
              
              *You can find more guidance on security in our [Fix Bugs with Confidence: Debugging Your Lovable App](https://littleparrot.app/aaab45b7-209a-4578-a515-3e55687f0c53/course-overview) micro-course.*

          title: Browser testing
          content:
            body: |-
              Lovable has a feature that lets you ask it to **test your app in a real browser**. This means Lovable can interact with your app like a real user would, and report back what it finds.

              **What browser testing can do:**
              - Capture screenshots to verify layouts look right
              - Simulate clicks and user interactions
              - Monitor what's happening behind the scenes
              - Test how your app looks on different screen sizes

              **How to use it:** After building a feature, send a follow-up prompt asking Lovable to verify it works. Phrases like `verify it works`, `test this`, or `check if clicking the button does what it should` will trigger browser testing.

              **Best practice:** Verify the test steps actually make sense for what you want to check. You can even specify exact actions for Lovable to perform.

              **Note:** Browser testing cannot test everything in your app, for example it cannot automatically log in with Google authentication. It’s best for straightforward interactions. So you should still manually test important features yourself.

              - It uses too many credits
              - Lovable refuses to build complex features
              - Too many plans make your app slower
            correctAnswer: 0
            explanation: This is called "context rot." When the conversation becomes too long or cluttered, the AI model starts to ignore, forget, or misinterpret earlier details, leading to less accurate or confused responses.

              - In the dedicated Add Secret panel

              Take a few minutes to set up:
              - **Favicon:** The small icon that appears in browser tabs. Upload something simple, like your logo.
              - **Title and Description:** These appear when someone shares your link. Make them clear and inviting.
              - **Share Image:** The image that shows when your app is shared on social media.

              All these details can be reffered to as **meta tags** in web development.

              These small details can be accessed by 
              1. clicking the **Publish** button and 
              2. opening the **Website info** section. 
              
              They will make your app feel more polished and professional.

          content:
            body: |-
              By default, Lovable gives your app a URL (e.g. book-club-picks.lovable.app). That works, but it might not be what you want.

              You can set a **Published URL** to make your link easier to remember:
              1. Click the **Publish** button
              2. In the **Published URL** field, enter something short and descriptive
              3. Save your changes

              A clean URL makes your app feel more professional and is easier for people to remember and type.

              **Note:** Your URL will end with `.lovable.app`. If you want a custom domain (like `book-club.com`) you'll need to buy it separately and set it in Lovable.

              This means you can **publish early and improve based on feedback** without worrying about it being "perfect."

              Digital products are never done. They evolve. The apps you use every day get updates constantly.

          title: The 80/20 of Vibe Coding

            body: |-
              Here's something important to understand about vibe coding: **generating something is fast, but perfecting it takes time**.

              With Lovable, you can create a working app in minutes. That's the easy part. The effort comes in refining the details: getting the layout exactly right, handling every edge case, polishing the user experience.

              This is the 80/20 reality of vibe coding: **the first 80% happens quickly, but the final 20% takes most of your time**.

              **Don't let this discourage you.** It means you can get something useful out there fast, then improve it based on user feedback. That's more valuable than polishing in isolation.

              - What did you try to do first?
              - What frustrated you or didn’t work how you expected?
              - What one thing would you change to make it better?

              Their feedback is more valuable than any amount of solo polishing.

              ✓ **Handle security warnings** calmly, knowing they're normal and fixable

              ✓ **Publish your app** and share it with others

              ✓ **Know when to start over** vs when to iterate

              Most importantly, you've experienced the power of vibe coding: **you can build digital products by describing what you want.**

              **Keep going:** The more you build, the better you'll get at describing what you want. Every app teaches you something new.

              Good luck, and happy building! 🚀
