              What if you could build a real app, not a mockup, not a prototype, but actual working
              software, just by describing what you want? That's exactly what you're about to do.
              In this micro-course, you'll learn vibe coding: a way of building apps by explaining
              what you want in plain English. No coding required. You'll write your first structured
              prompt, see Lovable turn it into a working app, and learn to add features one step at
              a time. By the end, you'll have a published app live on the internet that you can share
              with anyone. Along the way, you'll discover Lovable's interface, learn to experiment
              safely with bookmarks and reverts, and understand when to tweak versus when to start
              fresh. Ready to build something real? Let's go!

            body: |-
              **Vibe coding** is a way of building software by describing what you want instead of writing code. You explain how the app should look, feel, and behave, and an AI tool like Lovable translates your words into a working product.

              It's called "vibe coding" because you're communicating the vibe of what you want, not the technical details. The AI handles the technical bits.

            body: |-
              Lovable builds **web applications**, meaning software that runs in a browser on phones, tablets, and computers. Think of apps like Notion, Trello, or Google Docs. These are all web apps.

              *Fun fact:* Little Parrot (the platform you are using right now) was built with Lovable.

          title: Why structure is important
          content:
            body: |-
              Here's something important: **vague prompts get vague results**.

              If you tell Lovable `make me an app for my book club,` you'll get something generic. It might work, but it probably won't match what you imagined.

              The secret to getting closer to what you want on the first try? A **structured prompt**.

          title: The prompt formula
          content:
            body: |-
              This formula helps you describe your app clearly:

              ```markdown
              ## Product overview
              [What is this app? What problem does it solve?]

              ## User flow
              [What does the user do, step by step?]

              ## Platform requirements
              - Mobile-first layout
              - Accessible (WCAG AA compliance)

              ## Design system
              - Brand colours
              - Fonts
              - Style

              ## Implementation details
              [Any specific technical requirements]

              ## Target user
              [Who is this app for?]
              ```

              Don't worry if you don't know what to put in every section yet. You can start simple and add detail later. The structure itself helps Lovable understand what you're after.

              Here's a mindset that will save you time and frustration: **don't try to build everything at once**.

              It's tempting to describe your entire vision in one big prompt. But this often backfires. Lovable might misunderstand part of it, or build things in a way that you envisioned differently. You end up spending more effort fixing than you would have spent building step by step.

              Instead, start with one core user flow. Get that working. Then add the next piece.

              Dalmie's friend Sarah runs a book club, but coordination is a nightmare. Messages are scattered across WhatsApp, book suggestions get lost, and they spend more time figuring out logistics than actually reading.

              Dalmie wants to help. Her full vision includes suggesting books, voting, tracking what they're reading, and more. But for her first prompt, she focuses on just one thing: **a place to collect book suggestions**.

              ## Product overview
              A simple app where book club members can suggest books for the group to read next.

              ## User flow
              1. User opens the app and sees a list of book suggestions
              2. User can add a new suggestion with the book title and a short note about why they recommend it

              ## Platform requirements
              - Mobile-first layout
              - Accessible (WCAG AA compliance)

              Notice **what Dalmie left out:** voting, deadlines, current book tracking, organiser controls. Those will come later.

              Right now, she just wants to see Lovable create a clean list where people can add suggestions. **One thing at a time.**

              This approach means if something goes wrong, she knows exactly what caused it. And she **stays in control** of how her app grows.

            question: Why do structured prompts work better than vague ones?
            options:
              - They use fewer credits
              - They help Lovable understand exactly what you want
              - They make the app you're building run faster
              - They look more professional
            correctAnswer: 1
            explanation: Research shows that AI works better with structured prompts. When you clearly lay out what you’re building – using markdown formatting, numbered lists – Lovable is less likely to misunderstand you, which saves time and gets you better results sooner.

          title: 'Quiz: Starting small'
          content:
            question: Why should you start with one core user flow instead of describing everything at once?
            options:
              - It's cheaper, and I really don't want to spend too many credits
              - Big prompts are not allowed
              - If something goes wrong, you know what caused it and can fix it easily
              - Lovable can only build one feature at a time
            correctAnswer: 2
            explanation: When you build one feature at a time, you can quickly spot anything that’s off, whether it’s something you didn’t ask for, something you don’t like, or something that doesn’t work properly. It keeps things manageable and puts you in control of how your app develops.

              You might be wondering: why didn't we include voting, deadlines, and everything else in the first prompt? **Wouldn't it be faster to describe it all at once?**

              Here's **what actually happens** when you try that:
              - Lovable might misunderstand one part, and that mistake ripples through everything else
              - It might build something that you didn't quite imagine
              - You get a complex app that's harder to understand and fix
              - You spend more time untangling problems than you saved by combining prompts

          title: The benefits of building one feature at a time
          content:
            body: |-
              Building **one feature at a time** means:
              - You can test each piece before adding the next
              - Problems are easier to spot and fix
              - You stay in control of how your app grows

              **This also helps with credits.** Lovable uses credits based on the complexity of your request. A detailed, focused prompt often uses fewer credits than a mega-prompt followed by lots of fixes.

              Here’s a freeing thought: **starting over is often cheap**, especially early on.
              
              After your first few prompts, **pause and take a look** at what Lovable has built. If something fundamental feels off, it’s usually faster to start again with a clearer prompt than to keep fixing it.

              This doesn’t mean you should throw everything away after weeks of work. But in the early stages, restarting can save time and frustration.

          content:
            body: |-
              **Tweak** when the structure is right but details need adjusting. For example:
              - The button colour is wrong
              - The text needs editing
              - The spacing looks off

              **Start fresh** when the fundamental approach is wrong. For example:
              - The layout doesn't match what you imagined
              - The app flow is confusing
              - Lovable built something completely different from what you described

            body: |-
              Right now, Dalmie's app stores data locally in the browser. That means if Sarah closes the tab or uses a different device, all the book suggestions disappear.

              For a real app that multiple people can use, you need a **backend**: a place to store data that everyone can access.

              **Why do this early?** Adding a backend later, after you've built lots of features, often causes problems. Things that worked locally might break when connected to real storage. It's much easier to set this up now, while your app is still simple.

              **Lovable Cloud** takes care of the behind-the-scenes work your app needs. It gives your app:
              - **Data storage:** Save book suggestions, votes, and anything else so they persist
              - **User accounts:** Let people create an account and sign in
              - **Shared access:** Multiple people can use the same app and see the same data
              - **Connections to other services:** Send emails, process payments, and more

              For most apps, Lovable Cloud is the simplest way to add these capabilities.

              To connect your app to Lovable Cloud, you can simply prompt Lovable:

              Connect this app to Lovable Cloud so that data is saved and accessible from any device.
              ```

              Lovable will set up the backend for you. After this, any data your app creates will be stored properly.

              You only need to do this once. From now on, new features you add will automatically use the backend.

              When Lovable needs to change how your data is stored, it will ask for your permission first. You'll see a **Modify database** message showing exactly what Lovable plans to do, like creating a new table for book suggestions or adding a column for votes.

              **This is normal and expected.** Lovable is being careful with your data. Simply review what it wants to do and click to **allow** the changes.

              You don't need to understand every detail. The key thing is that Lovable won't modify your database without checking with you first. This keeps you in control of what's happening with your app's data.

              Sometimes errors happen when connecting to Lovable Cloud or making changes to your app. Don't worry, this is a normal part of building.

              If you see an error, look for the **Try to fix** button. Clicking it tells Lovable to attempt an automatic repair. This often resolves the issue quickly.

              If the error persists or there's no "Try to fix" button, you'll need to investigate further. Debugging is a skill that every builder develops over time.

              *Want to learn how to handle errors confidently? Our [Fix Bugs with Confidence: Debugging Your Lovable App](https://littleparrot.app/aaab45b7-209a-4578-a515-3e55687f0c53/course-overview) micro-course teaches you exactly how to investigate and fix problems.*

              With Lovable Cloud connected, Dalmie wants to add voting. But wait, if anyone can vote without logging in, how would the app know who voted? Someone could vote multiple times.

              **Before building a feature, ask yourself: what does this feature need to work properly?**

              For voting, Dalmie needs users to log in first. That way, the app knows who each person is and can ensure everyone only votes once.

              Dalmie adds **Google Authentication** so book club members can log in:

              ```
              Add Google Authentication. Users should be able to sign in with their Google account. Show a "Sign in" button in the header. Once signed in, show their name and a "Sign out" button instead.
              ```

              Lovable Cloud makes this straightforward. After this prompt, users can **log in**, and the app will know who they are.

              ```

              Because users are logged in, the app knows who voted and can prevent duplicate votes.

              After adding a feature, take a moment to verify it works as expected. For the voting feature, Dalmie tests:

              1. **Try voting without logging in.** The app should prevent this or prompt to sign in.
              2. **Log in and vote.** The vote count should update.
              3. **Try voting again on the same book.** The app should prevent duplicate votes.
              4. **Check with another user.** Open the app in a different browser or incognito window, log in as someone else, and confirm the votes are visible.

              This quick check catches problems early. Get into the habit of testing each feature before moving on to the next.

          content:
            question: Why is it better to connect Lovable Cloud early rather than waiting until later?
            options:
              - It costs fewer credits to set up early
              - Lovable requires it before you can add more features
              - It makes your app run faster
              - You'll have to redo and retest already built features
            correctAnswer: 3
            explanation: If you wait to connect Lovable Cloud – the system that saves and manages data – until after you’ve built most of the screens, you’ll probably have to redo a lot of work later, as the structure of your app changed. You'll also need to retest everything you've built up to that point to make sure everything still works.

              Products are never done. They evolve. The apps you use every day get updates constantly.

              There's a useful rule called the 80/20 reality: **getting to 80% takes 20% of the effort. The final 20% takes the remaining 80%.**

              This means a simple, working version is achievable quickly. Polishing every detail takes much longer. For now, focus on getting something useful out there.

              Share your app with one person. Maybe a friend, a potential user, or someone who fits your target audience. Ask them:
              - What makes sense?
              - What's confusing?
              - What would they want to see added?

              Their feedback is more valuable than any amount of solo polishing.

            question: What happens when you publish your app?
            options:
              - It appears on Google immediately
              - Everyone on the internet can find it
              - It gets a URL that only people you share it with will see
              - It costs extra credits
            correctAnswer: 2
            explanation: Your published app gets a URL, but nobody will find it unless you share the link. This means you can publish early and improve based on feedback without worrying about it being "perfect."

              ✓ **Write structured prompts** that get you closer to what you want on the first try

              ✓ **Build in small steps**, testing each feature before adding the next

              ✓ **Use Lovable's interface** confidently: preview, visual edits, bookmarks, reverts

              ✓ **Handle security warnings** calmly, knowing they're normal and fixable

              ✓ **Publish your app** and share it with others

              ✓ **Know when to start over** vs when to iterate

              Most importantly, you've experienced the core truth of vibe coding: **you can build real things by describing what you want.**

              **Keep going:** The more you build, the better you'll get at describing what you want. Every app teaches you something new.

              Good luck, and happy building! 🚀
