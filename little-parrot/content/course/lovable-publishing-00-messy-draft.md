- The 512MB limit isn't documented in Lovable's official docs. However, there is a hard limit of 512MB on the encoded project size for deployment. This appears to be an infrastructure-level constraint rather than a publicly documented one. You might get over this limit if you store large binary files in public/ — particularly MP4 videos and numerous GIFs/images.
