# Course Outline: Launch and Grow Your Lovable App

**Full title:** Launch and Grow Your Lovable App

## Overview

This micro-course takes learners from "I've built something in Lovable" to "I'm running a real product that people can discover, trust, and use." It covers everything between hitting the publish button and growing a live product: production readiness, custom domains, legal compliance, search engine discoverability, analytics, and distribution.

The narrative follows Dalmie, who built a Book Club Organiser for her friend, Sarah's book club in a previous course. She's ready to share it with the world, but quickly realises that publishing is more than one button click. Through six challenges, she turns her side project into a product her friend's book club members (and eventually, strangers) can find, trust, and rely on.

By the end, learners will be able to confidently launch a production-ready web application, set up a custom domain, handle legal essentials, make their product discoverable through search engines, track what matters with analytics, and plan their growth strategy.

## Structure

### 1. Go Live: Your First Real Launch
Make your app production-ready and share it with a real person.

- The comic/story hook: Dalmie shares her Book Club Organiser link with her friend, Sarah, but the friend sees test data, a generic favicon, and a "lovable.app" URL. "Is this... real?" The moment every builder dreads.
- What "publish" means in Lovable
- Preview vs production: two different worlds
- Switch to real API keys before going live (and why forgetting this is a common gotcha)
- Generate a favicon using free online tools
- Set meta tags: the title and description people see when you share your link
- Hit publish and share your URL with one potential user
- Exercise: Prepare your app for production, publish it, and share the link with someone. Watch them use it.

### 2. Claim Your Corner of the Internet: Custom Domains
Give your product a branded address.

- Why a custom domain is useful: credibility, memorability, and ownership
- How to buy a domain (popular registrars and what to look for)
- How to check if a custom domain is available
- How to connect a custom domain in Lovable
- Add a Google site verification TXT entry in your domain settings
- Example: Dalmie connects bookcluborganiser.com and her digital product looks professional
- Exercise: Buy or choose a custom domain and connect it to your Lovable app.

### 3. Build Trust: Legal Pages and Compliance
The things that make visitors feel safe using your product.

- Why legal pages are important (it's about trust, not just compliance)
- Privacy policy and terms of use: generate them with Termly
- What footer links to add and where to place them
- Cookie banners: when you need one and how to create one
- Example: Dalmie adds a privacy policy and terms. She's growing her app with other book clubs (people she doesn't know!)
- Exercise: Generate your privacy policy and terms of use, add footer links, and set up a cookie banner if needed.

### 4. Get Found: SEO and Discoverability
Help people find your product without you having to share every link by hand.

- How users actually find websites (search engines, AI assistants, social media, word of mouth)
- SEO basics for your Lovable app: titles, descriptions, semantic HTML
- Expactation management: it might take months to appear on Google, usually it takes a few weeks, in happy case, a few days
- GEO (Generative Engine Optimisation): making your product findable by AI tools, not just Google
- Register your business location on Google for local discoverability
- Generate backlinks: what they are and practical ways to get them
- Example: Dalmie searches "book club organiser app" and finds her own product on the second page. A month later, it's on the first.
- Exercise: Optimise your meta tags, set up Google site verification, and register your business on Google.

### 5. Track Your App Is Used: Metrics and Feedback
Understand what's happening with your product and what your users think.

- Built-in Lovable metrics: what's available out of the box
- Adding Google Analytics: a step-by-step walkthrough
- What to track early on (and what to ignore)
- How to ask users for feedback without being annoying
- Distribution channels: where to share your product to reach more people
- Example: Dalmie discovers that most of her users visit on Sunday evenings (right before book club). She starts sending reminders on Sunday afternoons.
- Exercise: Set up Google Analytics, check your built-in metrics, and have one feedback conversation with a real user.

### 6. Launch Early, Grow Steadily
The mindset and practices that turn a side project into a growing product.

- When to launch: the case for "before you're ready"
- How Buffer launched with a landing page and no product (and what you can learn from it)
- Agile development: what it means for solo builders (build, measure, learn, repeat)
- Scaling with Lovable: what to know as your user base grows
- The 512MB deployment limit: what it is, how to stay under it, and what to do if you hit it (The 512MB limit isn't documented in Lovable's official docs. However, there is a hard limit of 512MB on the encoded project size for deployment. This appears to be an infrastructure-level constraint rather than a publicly documented one. You might get over this limit if you store large binary files in public/ — particularly MP4 videos and numerous GIFs/images.)
- Your production-ready checklist: everything in one place
- Example: Dalmie launches her app to three book clubs. She keeps a simple list of feedback and ships one improvement each week.
- Exercise: Create your launch plan. Pick one distribution channel, set a launch date, and share your production-ready checklist with a friend for accountability.

## Narrative Arc

The course follows a launch progression:

1. **Ship it:** Get your app live and in front of a potential user
2. **Own it:** Give it a branded home with a custom domain
3. **Protect it:** Build trust with legal pages and compliance
4. **Spread it:** Make it discoverable through search and AI
5. **Understand it:** Track how it's used and listen to users
6. **Grow it:** Adopt the mindset and habits of a product builder

Each challenge builds on the previous one. By the end, learners have a live, discoverable, trustworthy product and a plan for growing it.

## Running Example

Dalmie and the Book Club Organiser app she initially built for her friend, Sarah, but then turning it into a digital product, continuing from the "Build Your First App with Lovable" course. Dalmie has a working app, Sarah's book club started using it. Now she needs to turn it into something other book club users (she doesn't know) can find, trust, and use regularly.
