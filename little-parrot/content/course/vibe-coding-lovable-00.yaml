              Have you ever had a brilliant idea for an app but felt stuck because you can't code?
              That's exactly what Lovable is here to change. Lovable is an AI-powered app builder
              that turns your words into working web applications. You describe what you want in
              plain English, and Lovable builds it for you. No coding required. In this micro-course,
              you'll learn the basics of building with Lovable, from your very first prompt to
              publishing your app online. By the end, you'll have the confidence to bring your
              ideas to life. Let's get started!

              **Lovable** is an AI-powered tool that builds web applications from your descriptions. You tell it what you want in everyday language, and it writes the code for you.

              Think of it as having a developer on call who works incredibly fast and never gets tired. You describe, it builds. You give feedback, it improves. It's a conversation that results in a working app.

            body: |-
              **Vibe coding** is the practice of building software by describing what you want rather than writing code yourself. You focus on the *vibe* you're going for, the look, the feel, the functionality, and the AI handles the technical details.

              It's called vibe coding because you're communicating your vision, not syntax. The better you can describe what you want, the better the results. This micro-course will teach you exactly how to do that.

            body: |-
              Currently, Lovable builds **web applications**. These are apps that run in a web browser on any device, phone, tablet, or computer.

              You can build things like:
              - Landing pages for your business
              - Simple tools and calculators
              - Personal dashboards
              - Community platforms
              - Booking systems
              - And much more!

              If it can live in a browser, Lovable can likely help you build it.

          content:
            body: |-
              Here's an honest truth about AI app building: **Lovable can get you from 0 to 80% remarkably fast**, often in minutes or hours rather than weeks.

              But that last 20%? That takes more time and iteration. It's the fine-tuning, the edge cases, the small details that make an app truly polished.

              This isn't a limitation; it's actually incredible. Getting 80% of the way to a working app in an afternoon is something that wasn't possible just a few years ago!

          content:
            body: |-
              That remaining 20% is where **iteration** comes in. You'll test your app, find things that don't quite work, and improve them. This is normal! Even professional developers spend most of their time in this refinement phase.

              The good news: each iteration gets faster as you learn to communicate more clearly with Lovable. What took several attempts at first will soon take just one well-crafted prompt.

              Here's a mindset shift that will serve you well: **a product is never truly "done"**.

              Projects have end dates. Products evolve. The apps you use every day, your email, your favourite social media, they're constantly being updated and improved.

              Your app is the same. Launch it when it's useful, then keep making it better based on what you learn from real users. Perfect is the enemy of shipped!

              Vibe coding is an evolving field. Lovable itself updates frequently with new capabilities. What worked last month might have an even better approach today.

              This means:
              - Be patient with yourself as you learn
              - Experiment and explore
              - Don't be afraid to start over if something isn't working
              - Join communities to learn from others

              Everyone starts somewhere. The skills you build now will only become more valuable as AI tools improve.

          content:
            question: What does "0 to 80%" mean in the context of AI app building?
            options:
              - Lovable only builds 80% of features
              - You can get most of a working app quickly, but refinement takes more time
              - The app will only work 80% of the time
              - You need to write 20% of the code yourself
            correctAnswer: 1
            explanation: AI app builders like Lovable can get you most of the way to a working app very quickly. The remaining polish and fine-tuning requires iteration, but you'll have something functional to work with much faster than traditional development.

          content:
            question: Why is it important to think of your app as a "product" rather than a "project"?
            options:
              - Products cost more money
              - Products are never truly finished; they evolve based on user feedback
              - Projects are easier to build
              - Products require a team
            correctAnswer: 1
            explanation: Thinking of your app as a product helps you embrace continuous improvement rather than waiting for "perfect." Launch when it's useful, then keep making it better based on real feedback.

              Throughout this course, we'll follow **Dalmie**, who's building a Book Club Organiser app. Dalmie runs a book club but struggles with the chaos of coordinating which book to read next.

              **The problem:** Messages scattered across WhatsApp, important decisions buried in off-topic chat, and half the members missing the vote.

              **The solution:** A simple app where members can suggest books and vote on what to read next.

              You can follow along with Dalmie's example or adapt the prompts for your own idea!

              Create a simple page where book club members can see a list of suggested books and vote for their favourite.
              ```

              That's it! No technical details needed. Lovable will interpret this and create something for you.

              **Your turn:** Type a similar prompt into Lovable. You can use Dalmie's exact words, or describe your own simple idea.

              After you submit your prompt, Lovable will start generating your app. You'll see code appearing on the left and a preview on the right.

              **What to notice:**
              - The preview updates as code is written
              - You can click around in the preview to test it
              - It might not be exactly what you imagined, and that's okay!

              This first version is your starting point. You'll refine it with more prompts.

              While simple prompts work, **structured prompts work better**. A well-organised prompt helps Lovable understand exactly what you want, reducing back-and-forth.

              Think of it like giving directions. "Go left, then right" might work, but "Turn left at the bakery, then right at the post office, the blue house is third on the left" gets you there faster.

              Let's learn a prompt formula that works consistently.

              ## User flow
              [What will users do in the app, step by step?]

              ## Platform requirements
              - It's a mobile-first platform. Optimise layout, font sizes, and buttons for mobile. Prioritise speed and readability.
              - The platform is accessible. Implement WCAG AA compliance.

              ## Design system

              A book club organiser app where members suggest books and vote on what to read next.

              ## User flow
              1. See a list of suggested books with vote counts
              2. Add a new book suggestion (title and author)
              3. Vote for a book by clicking a button
              4. See the current leader highlighted

              ## Platform requirements
              - Mobile-first design
              - Accessible for all users

              ## Design system
              - Warm, cozy colours (deep reds, cream backgrounds)
              - Friendly, readable fonts
              - Simple and uncluttered layout
              ```

              Notice how much clearer this is? Lovable has everything it needs to build something close to Dalmie's vision.

              Lovable tends to generate more than you ask for when prompts are vague. It tends to generate exactly what you need when you're specific and progress incrementally.

              **Good approach:**
              1. Build the basic page
              2. Add voting functionality
              3. Add the ability to suggest new books
              4. Polish the design

              **Risky approach:**
              - "Build everything including user accounts, notifications, book covers from APIs, reading tracking, and a discussion forum"

              Small steps = fewer surprises = better results.

            question: Why is a structured prompt better than a simple one?
            options:
              - It uses more credits
              - It helps Lovable understand exactly what you want

              - Simple prompts don't work at all
            correctAnswer: 1
            explanation: Structured prompts give Lovable clear context about what you're building, who it's for, and how it should work. This reduces misunderstandings and gets you closer to what you want on the first try.

            options:
              - To save money on credits
              - Because Lovable can only handle one feature
              - To get more predictable results and catch issues early
              - Because small apps are better than big apps
            correctAnswer: 2
            explanation: Building incrementally means you can test each feature as you add it. If something goes wrong, you know exactly what caused it. Large, complex prompts can lead to unexpected results that are harder to fix.

              **How:** Click the bookmark icon on a response in your chat history.

              **Why:** If future changes break something, you have a known good state to return to. You can also ask Lovable to "compare the current version to the last bookmarked version" to see what changed.

              **When:** After every feature that works! Make it a habit.

              **What you can do:**
              - Change colours
              - Edit text directly
              - Adjust spacing
              - Modify fonts

              **Limitation:** This only works for static elements. Dynamic content (like book titles from a database) needs prompts.

              Lovable uses a credit system. **Credits are consumed based on the complexity of your request**, not simply the number of prompts.

              A simple text change uses fewer credits than generating an entire new feature. This is why structured, clear prompts matter; they help Lovable understand what you want without wasted effort.

              **Progress in small steps:** Instead of one massive prompt, break your work into smaller pieces. Easier to understand = fewer wasted credits on fixing misunderstandings.

              **Be specific:** Vague prompts lead to Lovable guessing, which might not match what you wanted. The clearer you are, the fewer revision cycles you need.

              **Use visual edits for small changes:** Changing text, colours, or spacing? Visual edits are often free or very low cost compared to prompts.

              **Bookmark working versions:** If you need to revert and redo, you won't waste credits rebuilding from scratch.

              Here's an important mindset: **don't avoid building iteratively to "save" credits**.

              Trying to cram everything into one prompt to save credits usually backfires. The resulting mess often costs more credits to fix than a steady, incremental approach.

              Think of credits as fuel for exploration. A few well-spent credits on clear, small prompts can save many more later. Some back-and-forth while refining is normal and expected!

            question: When should you use Planning mode?
            options:
              - Never, it slows things down
              - When you want to understand what will change before it happens
              - Only for the first prompt
              - Only when debugging
            correctAnswer: 1
            explanation: Planning mode is perfect for significant changes where you want to review the approach before Lovable starts building. It helps you catch potential issues before they happen and understand what you're about to get.

          content:
            question: Where should you store API keys in Lovable?
            options:
              - In your prompts
              - In the code directly
              - In the dedicated Secrets section
              - In knowledge files
            correctAnswer: 2
            explanation: API keys should always go in the Secrets section, never in prompts or code. This keeps them secure and prevents them from being accidentally exposed.

              Start with this prompt:

              ```markdown
              ## Product overview
              A book club organiser where members suggest and vote on books.

              ## User flow
              1. See a list of suggested books with vote counts
              2. Click a vote button to add a vote

              ## Design system
              - Warm, cozy colours (deep burgundy, cream)
              - Clean, simple layout
              - Mobile-first design
              ```

              Now add the ability to suggest books:

              ```
              Add a form at the top where users can suggest a new book. The form should have fields for book title and author name. When submitted, the book appears in the list with 0 votes.
              ```

              Test it by adding a few books. Does it work? **Bookmark this version!**

              Now make it look great:

              ```
              Make the book list visually appealing:
              - Each book should be a card with slight shadow
              - The book with the most votes should be highlighted with a subtle gold border
              - Add a small icon next to the vote count
              - Make the vote button more prominent
              ```

              Use Visual edits to fine-tune any text or colours that aren't quite right.

              Add a favicon with a book icon, set the page title to "Book Club Organiser", and add a meta description "Vote on your next book club read together."
              ```

              Now publish your app! Share the link with someone and ask them to suggest a book and vote.
