            transcript: |-
              You've built an app with Lovable. That's a real achievement. But right now, it
              probably lives on a generic URL, has a default favicon, and maybe still uses test
              data. If you share it with someone, they might wonder: is this a real product?
              That's about to change.
              In this micro-course, you'll go from "I built an app" to "I'm running a product
              that people can find, trust, and use." You'll publish your app properly, set up a
              custom domain, add legal pages, make it discoverable through search engines and AI
              tools, track how people use it, and plan your growth.
              By the end, you won't just have an app. You'll have a live product with a
              professional presence on the internet. And you'll know exactly how to keep
              improving it based on what your users tell you.
              Ready to launch? Let's go!

          title: What "publish" means in Lovable
          content:
            body: |-
              When you **publish** in Lovable, your app becomes accessible on the internet. Anyone with the link can visit it from their phone, tablet, or computer.

              **Before publishing**, your app exists only in Lovable's editor. **After publishing**, it gets a real URL that you can share with anyone.

              Publishing is a bit like opening a shop. Before you open the doors, you want to make sure the shelves are stocked and the sign looks right. That's what the next few steps are about.

          content:
            body: |-
              Lovable gives you **two environments**:

              **Preview** is your testing playground. It's where you build your product, test how it works, and experiment without consequences. Think of it like a dress rehearsal.

              **Production** is the real thing. It's what your users see when they visit your published URL.

              Changes you make in the editor show up in preview immediately. But they only reach production when you click **Publish**. This separation is your safety net. You can break things in preview, fix them, and your users never see a thing.

          title: Switch to real API keys before going live
          content:
            body: |-
              If your app connects to **external services** (like Stripe for payments or a third-party email provider), you may have **test API keys** stored in Lovable. These work fine for development, but they won't work properly for real users.

              **Forgetting to switch them** is a common gotcha. Your app will look like it works, but behind the scenes, data might not save, emails might not send, or payments might not process. A quick check now saves confusion later.

              *If API keys are new to you, our [Basics of Software for Vibe Coding](https://littleparrot.app/4794366d-b807-4804-8fd5-64c3a5a03472/course-overview) micro-course explains them in friendly terms.*

          title: How to check and update your API keys
          content:
            body: |-
              **Here's how to find and update your API keys in Lovable:**

              1. In your Lovable project, open the **Cloud** tab (click the **+** button next to Preview at the top of the screen)
              2. Go to the **Secrets** section. You'll see a list of all the secrets (API keys) your app uses. Some keys are added automatically by Lovable and cannot be deleted. (These will have a *Lovable* label next to them.)
              3. To **update a key** you added, copy its name (e.g., `STRIPE_API_KEY`), paste it in the **Name** field. Then add the corresponding production API key from your external service, and paste that in the **Value** field. Make sure to save your changes. This will override the previously saved key.

              If your app doesn't use any external services yet, you can skip this step. Lovable's own API keys are managed automatically.

          title: Give your app a favicon
          content:
            body: |-
              A **favicon** is the small icon that appears in browser tabs next to your app's name. Without one, your app shows Lovable's icon, which is a bit misleading for your users.

              You can **create a favicon for free** using tools like [realfavicongenerator.net](https://realfavicongenerator.net/). Upload your logo, your brand initials, or a simple icon that represents your product. These tools will generate the right file format and sizes for you automatically.

              It's a small detail, but it **makes a noticeable difference**. When Sarah sees the Book Club Organiser tab in her browser with a proper icon, it feels like a real product. Let's see how to set it.

          content:
            body: |-
              If you **haven't published** yet:
              1. Click the **Publish** button in the top-right corner
              2. Follow the steps until you reach the one called **Website info**
              2. In the **Icon & title** section, click the favicon area (a Lovable logo appears there by default) and upload your generated file

              If you've **already published**:
              1. Click the **Publish** button in the top-right corner
              2. Click the **Edit settings** button
              2. In the **Website info** section, click the pencil icon
              3. In the **Icon & title** section, click the favicon area and upload your generated file

              You can **change your favicon at any time**, so don't worry about getting it perfect on the first try. Once you set your custom favicon, publish your app and it will show up in the browser tab when users visit your app.

            body: |-
              **Meta tags** control how your app appears when someone shares the link on social media, or messaging services (like WhatsApp, or Slack). They include:

              - **Title:** The name that appears in link previews and browser tabs
              - **Description:** A short summary that appears below the title
              - **Social image:** The image that shows in social media previews

              You can set all of these in the **Website info** section of the Publish panel (the same place you uploaded your favicon).

              Make your title clear (e.g., "Book Club Organiser") and your description inviting (e.g., "The easiest way to pick your book club's next read"). For the share image, use a 1200x630 pixel image for best results on social media. You can create one for free with tools like [Canva](https://www.canva.com/).

              When someone shares your link, these details are the **first impression**.

            question: What is the difference between preview and production in Lovable?
            options:
              - Preview is faster, production is slower
              - Preview is free, production costs extra
              - Preview is your testing environment, production is what real users see
              - Preview shows code, production shows the app
            correctAnswer: 2
            explanation: Preview is the environment where you build your app and test changes safely. Production is the live version your users see. Changes only reach production when you click Publish, which means you can experiment in preview without affecting real users.

          title: "Quiz: API keys"
          content:
            question: Why should you check your API keys before publishing?
            options:
              - Test keys won't work properly for real users
              - Production keys are cheaper to use
              - Test keys make the app slower
              - Production keys unlock more features in Lovable
            correctAnswer: 0
            explanation: Test API keys are designed for development and testing your app works as expected, not real users. If you forget to switch to production keys, features like payments, or sending emails will not work, even though the app looks fine on the surface.

          content:
            body: |-
              Right now, your app lives at something like `book-club-picks.lovable.app`. That works, but it's not very memorable. And when Sarah shares it with other book club organisers, they might hesitate to click a link they don't recognise.

              A **custom domain** like `bookcluborganiser.com` gives your product:
              - **Credibility:** It looks like a real business, not a side project
              - **Memorability:** People can type it from memory
              - **Ownership:** You control the address, even if you move to a different platform later

              A custom domain is not required to launch. But if you're serious about growing your product, it's one of the most impactful steps you can take.

          title: How to check if a domain is available
          content:
            body: |-
              Before you buy, you need to check if your desired domain name is available. Here are a few ways to do this:

              - Visit a domain registrar like [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/), [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/), or [Google Domains](https://domains.google/) and search for your name
              - Try variations if your first choice is taken (e.g., `getbookclub.com`, `mybookclub.app`, `bookclubhq.com`)

              **Tips for choosing a good domain:**
              - Keep it short and easy to spell
              - Avoid hyphens and numbers if possible
              - `.com` is the most recognised, but `.app`, `.io`, and country-specific domains (like `.co.uk`) work well too
              - Say it out loud. If you have to spell it for someone, it might be too complicated

          title: How to buy and connect a domain
          content:
            body: |-
              Once you've found an available domain, buying it takes a few minutes on the registrar's website. Most domains cost between $10-15 per year.

              To connect it to your Lovable app:
              1. Click the **Publish** button in Lovable
              2. Find the **Custom domain** section
              3. Enter your domain name
              4. Lovable will show you the **DNS records** you need to add (usually a CNAME or A record)
              5. Go to your domain registrar's website, log in, and look for **DNS Management**, **DNS Settings**, or **Advanced DNS** (the exact name varies, but it's usually in the domain's settings page)
              6. Add the records exactly as Lovable shows them. You'll typically need to enter a **Type** (like CNAME), a **Host** (like `@` or `www`), and a **Value** (the address Lovable gives you)

              DNS changes can take a few minutes to a few hours to take effect. Don't worry if it doesn't work immediately. This is called **DNS propagation** and it's completely normal.

              *DNS (Domain Name System) is like a phone book for the internet. It tells browsers which server to connect to when someone types your domain name.*

          content:
            body: |-
              While you're in your domain settings, it's a good time to set up **Google site verification**. This proves to Google that you own the domain, which is useful for:
              - Submitting your site to Google Search (so it can be found)
              - Accessing Google Search Console (to see how people find you)
              - Setting up Google Analytics later

              To verify your domain:
              1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
              2. Add your domain
              3. Google will give you a TXT record to add to your DNS settings
              4. Add it in your domain registrar, the same place you added the Lovable DNS records

              This step takes less than five minutes and unlocks tools you'll use in later challenges.

              When someone visits your product for the first time, they're making a quick decision: **do I trust this enough to use it?**

              Legal pages like a privacy policy and terms of use aren't exciting, but they signal that you take your product (and your users) seriously. They tell visitors:
              - How their data is handled
              - What they can expect from your product
              - That there's a real person or business behind it

              If you're collecting any user data (even email addresses for login), most countries require you to have a privacy policy. It's not about bureaucracy. It's about transparency and trust.

              Writing legal documents from scratch sounds intimidating, but you don't have to. **Termly** ([termly.io](https://termly.io/)) is a free tool that generates privacy policies and terms of use based on your answers to a questionnaire.

              Here's how it works:
              1. Create a free account on Termly
              2. Answer questions about your product (what data you collect, whether you use cookies, etc.)
              3. Termly generates the legal documents for you
              4. Copy the generated text or embed the hosted pages

              The questionnaire walks you through each decision, so you don't need legal knowledge. If you're unsure about an answer, Termly explains what each option means.

              Once Termly generates your documents, you have two options:
              - **Use Termly's hosted pages:** Copy the URL that Termly gives you (it looks like `app.termly.io/document/privacy-policy/your-id`). You'll link to these from your app's footer.
              - **Create pages in your app:** Prompt Lovable to create a Privacy Policy page and a Terms of Use page, then paste the generated text into those pages.

              The hosted option is easier to start with and updates automatically if you change your policies later.

              **Tip:** If you're using Google Analytics or Lovable Cloud (for data storage and authentication), you are collecting user data. Make sure to mention these in the questionnaire.

          content:
            body: |-
              Once you have your legal pages, you need to make them accessible. The standard place for legal links is the **footer** of your website, the section at the very bottom of the page.

              Common footer links include:
              - **Privacy Policy**
              - **Terms of Use** (sometimes called Terms of Service)
              - **Contact** (an email address or contact form)

              You can prompt Lovable to add these. If you're using Termly's hosted pages, include the URLs in your prompt:

              ```
              Add a footer to all pages with links to:
              - Privacy Policy: [paste your Termly privacy policy URL here]
              - Terms of Use: [paste your Termly terms URL here]
              - Contact: [your email address]
              Use a subtle design that doesn't distract from the main content. Open the links in a new tab.
              ```

              If you created the pages inside your app instead, replace the URLs with the page paths (e.g., `/privacy-policy`).

          content:

              A **cookie banner** is the notification that appears when you first visit a website, asking you to accept or manage cookies. Cookies are small files that websites store on your browser to remember things like your preferences or login status.

              **When do you need a cookie banner?**
              - If your users are in the EU or UK, you likely need one (GDPR and the UK's Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations require consent for non-essential cookies)
              - If you use Google Analytics, advertising tools, or third-party tracking, you need one
              - If you only use essential cookies (like keeping users logged in), you may not need one, but it's often safer to have one

              You can add a cookie banner by prompting Lovable directly:

              ```
              Add a cookie consent banner that appears at the bottom of the screen when a user first visits. It should have a brief message about using cookies, an "Accept" button, and a "Manage preferences" link. Save the user's choice so the banner doesn't appear again on their next visit.
              ```

              Alternatively, Termly can generate a cookie banner for you. If you use Termly's banner, it will give you a script tag to add. You can prompt Lovable: `"Add this script to the <head> of the app:"` and paste the Termly snippet.

              When in doubt, adding a cookie banner is the safer choice. It shows your users you respect their privacy.

              Dalmie generates her privacy policy and terms of use on Termly. She mentions that the Book Club Organiser uses Google Authentication and stores data in Lovable Cloud. Termly produces both documents in a few minutes.

              She prompts Lovable to add a footer with links to the privacy policy and terms. Since she's planning to add Google Analytics and her users include people in the UK, she also adds a cookie banner.

              The next time a new book club signs up, they see professional footer links and a clear cookie consent notice. It's a small thing, but it means people who don't know Dalmie personally still feel comfortable creating an account.

              - Cookie banners are required by Lovable before publishing
            correctAnswer: 2
            explanation: EU and UK privacy regulations (GDPR) require consent for non-essential cookies like those used by analytics tools. If you use Google Analytics and have users in these regions, a cookie banner is the right thing to add.

              Right now, the only way someone can reach your product is if you share the link directly. That's fine for your first few users, but it doesn't scale.

              People find websites through several channels:
              - **Search engines** like Google (someone types "book club organiser app")
              - **AI assistants** like ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Google's AI Overview (someone asks "what's a good tool for organising a book club?")
              - **Social media** (someone shares your link on LinkedIn, X, or Instagram)
              - **Word of mouth** (Sarah tells another book club organiser about it)
              - **Backlinks** from other websites that mention your product

              In this challenge, you'll learn how to improve your chances of being found through search engines and AI tools. The social media and word-of-mouth parts come down to marketing, which is a whole topic on its own.

              **SEO** stands for Search Engine Optimisation. It's the practice of making your website easier for search engines like Google to find and understand.

              The good news? You've already done some SEO work. Setting your meta tags (title and description) in Challenge 1 was your first step.

              Here are more things you can do:
              - **Use clear page titles** that describe what each page does
              - **Write descriptive headings** using heading tags (h1, h2, h3) in your content
              - **Add alt text to images** by prompting Lovable: `"Add descriptive alt text to all images in the app for accessibility and SEO"`
              - **Make your app fast** by keeping images small (compress them before uploading) and avoiding unnecessary complexity

              You can also ask Lovable to do a general review: `"Review this page for SEO best practices and suggest improvements."`

          content:
            body: |-
              Here's something important to know: **SEO results take time**.

              After you publish and set everything up, it might take:
              - **A few days** in the best case to start appearing in Google results
              - **A few weeks** in the typical case
              - **A few months** if your product is in a competitive space

              This can feel frustrating, but it's normal. Search engines need time to discover, crawl, and index your website. The Google site verification you set up in the previous challenge helps speed this up.

              You can submit your **sitemap** through [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console) to nudge Google to notice your site sooner. A sitemap is a file that lists all the pages on your website, making it easier for search engines to find and index them.

              To submit your sitemap:
              1. Open Google Search Console and select your property (the domain you verified in Challenge 2)
              2. Click **Sitemaps** in the left menu
              3. Enter your sitemap URL. For most Lovable apps, try `https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml`. If you're not sure whether your app has one, ask Lovable: `"Does this app have a sitemap.xml? If not, generate one."`
              4. Click **Submit**

              Don't let the wait discourage you. Every SEO improvement you make now compounds over time. The earlier you start, the sooner results arrive.

              **GEO** stands for Generative Engine Optimisation. It's a newer concept that focuses on making your product discoverable by AI tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google's AI Overview.

              When someone asks an AI assistant "what's a good tool for organising book clubs?", the AI draws from information it has found online. To increase your chances of being mentioned:

              - **Have a clear, descriptive homepage** that explains what your product does and who it's for
              - **Create helpful content** like a blog post or FAQ page that answers questions your target users might ask
              - **Get mentioned on other websites** (more on this in a moment)

              GEO and SEO overlap a lot. The same practices that help search engines understand your product also help AI tools recommend it.

              Even if your product is fully online, having a Google Business Profile can help because:
              - It makes your business appear in Google Maps and local search results
              - It adds credibility (Google shows your business info in search results)
              - It gives you another place to collect reviews

              Not every product needs this, but if yours has any local component (like a local book club organiser, a neighbourhood service, or a business with a physical address), it's worth the few minutes to set up.

              **Backlinks** are links from other websites that point to yours. Search engines treat them as votes of confidence. The more quality backlinks you have, the higher you'll rank.

              How to start building backlinks:
              - **List your product on directories** like Product Hunt, Indie Hackers, or niche directories for your industry
              - **Write a guest blog post** for a site that your target users read
              - **Ask partners or collaborators** to link to your product from their website
              - **Create something worth linking to**, like a useful guide, a free tool, or an interesting case study

              Dalmie writes a short blog post about "How I organised my book club with an app" and shares it on a few community forums. Within a few weeks, other book club blogs start linking to the Book Club Organiser. Her search ranking improves steadily.

              You've published your product, set up a domain, and started working on discoverability. But here's a question: **do you know what's actually happening?**

              Are people visiting? Which pages do they look at? Where do they drop off? What features do they use most?

              Without data, you're guessing. With data, you're making informed decisions about what to build next, what to fix, and where to focus your energy.

              Tracking doesn't need to be complicated. A few basic metrics can tell you a lot.

              To find them:
              1. Open your project in Lovable
              2. Click on your **project name** in the top-left corner to go to the project dashboard
              3. Look for the **Analytics** tab

              These metrics give you a basic picture of:

              - When they visit (time of day, day of week)
              - Basic usage patterns

              This is a great starting point. For most early-stage products, built-in metrics are enough to understand whether people are using your app and how often.

              Check your metrics regularly. Even a quick weekly glance helps you spot trends and notice if something changes unexpectedly.

              For more detailed insights, you can add **Google Analytics** to your app. It's free and gives you data about:
              - Where your visitors come from (search, social media, direct links)

              - What devices and browsers they use
              - Where they drop off in your user flow

              To set it up:
              1. Create a free account at [analytics.google.com](https://analytics.google.com/)
              2. Click **Admin** (gear icon at the bottom-left), then click **Create** and select **Property**
              3. Give your property a name (e.g., "Book Club Organiser"), select your country and time zone, then click through the setup steps
              4. When asked to choose a platform, select **Web**, enter your app's URL, and give your stream a name
              5. Google will show you a **Measurement ID** that starts with `G-` (e.g., `G-ABC123XYZ`). Copy it.
              6. Back in Lovable, prompt: `"Add Google Analytics with Measurement ID G-ABC123XYZ to the app"` (replacing with your actual ID)

              Lovable will add the tracking code to your app. After publishing, data will start appearing in your Google Analytics dashboard within a few hours.

              **Remember:** If you add Google Analytics and have users in the EU or UK, make sure you have a cookie banner (Challenge 3 covered this).

              It's tempting to get lost in dashboards and numbers. Here's what actually matters when you're starting out:

              **Track these:**
              - **Active users:** Are people coming back, or do they visit once and leave?
              - **Traffic sources:** How are people finding you? This tells you where to focus your marketing efforts.
              - **Key actions:** Are users completing the main action your app is designed for? (For Dalmie, that's adding book suggestions and voting.)

              **Ignore these (for now):**
              - Bounce rate on individual pages (too noisy with small traffic)
              - Detailed demographic breakdowns (not useful until you have more visitors)
              - Vanity metrics like total page views without context

              Dalmie discovers that most of her users visit on Sunday evenings, right before their book club meetings. She starts sending a reminder to her book clubs on Sunday afternoons, and engagement goes up.

          title: How to ask users for feedback
          content:
            body: |-
              Analytics tell you **what** people do. Feedback tells you **why**.

              The best feedback comes from real conversations. Here's how to ask without being annoying:

              **Ask specific questions, not generic ones:**
              - Instead of "What do you think?" try "What's the one thing you'd change?"
              - Instead of "Is it good?" try "What frustrated you when you used it?"
              - Instead of "Any feedback?" try "What did you try to do that didn't work?"

              **Ways to collect feedback:**
              - Have a short conversation (in person or video call) with 3-5 users
              - Add a simple feedback form or link in your app
              - Watch someone use your app without guiding them (you'll learn more from watching than asking)

              Every piece of feedback is a gift. It tells you what to build next and what to fix first.

          content:
            body: |-
              Your product won't grow on its own. You need to actively share it where your target users spend time.

              Here are some distribution channels to consider:
              - **Social media:** Share your product story on LinkedIn, X, Instagram, or Facebook groups
              - **Online communities:** Post in relevant forums, subreddits, or Slack groups
              - **Product directories:** List on Product Hunt, Indie Hackers, or niche directories
              - **Email:** If you have a mailing list, share updates and invite people to try your product
              - **Partnerships:** Collaborate with complementary products or creators

              Don't try all of these at once. Pick one or two channels where your target users are most active, and focus your energy there.

              - Whether users are completing the main action your app is designed for
              - Average time on page for every individual page
            correctAnswer: 2
            explanation: Early on, the most important thing to know is whether users are doing the thing your app was built for. Are they adding book suggestions? Voting? Completing the core action? This tells you whether your product is delivering value.

            correctAnswer: 0

          content:
            body: |-
              If you've been waiting for your product to be "done" before sharing it widely, here's a perspective shift: **your product will never feel done**. The apps you use every day, from Instagram to Google Maps, are constantly updated. "Done" doesn't exist in the world of digital products.

              Launching early means:
              - You learn from real users sooner
              - You avoid building features nobody wants
              - You build momentum instead of staying stuck in "almost ready" mode

              There's a famous quote from Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn: *"If you're not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late."*

              This doesn't mean shipping broken software. It means shipping something that works, even if it's basic, and improving it based on what you learn.

          content:
            body: |-
              **Buffer**, the social media scheduling tool used by millions, started with a landing page and nothing else.

              The founder, Joel Gascoigne, created a simple page that described what Buffer would do and had a "Plans and Pricing" button. When people clicked, they saw a message: "We're not quite ready yet. Leave your email and we'll let you know when we launch."

              That was the entire product. A landing page and an email signup form.

              But it answered the most important question: **do people actually want this?** Enough people signed up that Joel knew it was worth building. He then created a basic version, launched it to those email subscribers, and grew from there.

              The lesson? You don't need everything figured out before you launch. You need enough to test whether people care. Start small, learn fast, and grow from what works.

          content:
            body: |-
              **Agile development** is a way of building software in short cycles instead of one big push. Professional teams use agile frameworks with sprints, standups, and retrospectives. But for solo builders, the core idea is what matters:

              **Build, measure, learn, repeat.**

              1. **Build** one small feature or improvement
              2. **Measure** whether it works (check your analytics, test it yourself)
              3. **Learn** from what happened (did users engage with it? Did it break something?)
              4. **Repeat** with the next most important thing

              This cycle keeps you moving forward without getting overwhelmed. Instead of planning months of features, you focus on the next small step.

              Dalmie adopts this rhythm. Each week, she picks one improvement based on user feedback, builds it, publishes it, and checks how it's received. Her app gets better every week, and her users notice.

          title: Scaling with Lovable
          content:
            body: |-
              As your product grows, you might wonder: **can Lovable handle more users?**

              For most products, the answer is yes. Lovable apps are hosted on infrastructure designed to handle growth. Lovable Cloud automatically scales your backend (database, authentication, storage) as your usage increases.

              **One thing to watch: the 512MB deployment limit.**

              Lovable has a hard limit of 512MB on the encoded project size for deployment. You're unlikely to hit this with code and normal assets, but you might run into it if you store large files directly in your project, like MP4 videos, many GIFs, or high-resolution images.

              If you're approaching this limit:
              - Host large videos on platforms like YouTube or Vimeo and embed them
              - Use an image hosting service or CDN for large image collections
              - Compress images before adding them to your project

              For most products, this limit won't be a concern. But it's good to know about before it surprises you.

          content:
            body: |-
              Here's everything you've learned in this micro-course, collected into one checklist. Use it every time you prepare a product for launch:

              **Before publishing:**
              - ☐ Switch to production API keys
              - ☐ Create and upload a favicon
              - ☐ Set meta tags (title, description, share image)
              - ☐ Check your app on mobile and desktop (use the device toggle in Lovable's preview, and test on your own phone after publishing)

              **Professional touches:**
              - ☐ Connect a custom domain
              - ☐ Set up Google site verification
              - ☐ Add privacy policy and terms of use
              - ☐ Add footer links to legal pages
              - ☐ Add a cookie banner (if needed)

              **Discoverability:**
              - ☐ Optimise pages for SEO (headings, alt text, clear content)
              - ☐ Submit sitemap to Google Search Console
              - ☐ Register on Google Business Profile (if relevant)
              - ☐ List on at least one product directory

              **Growth:**
              - ☐ Set up analytics (built-in + Google Analytics)
              - ☐ Plan your first feedback conversation
              - ☐ Choose one distribution channel to focus on

              Save this checklist. Come back to it whenever you launch something new.

          title: "Quiz: Launching early"
          content:
            question: Why is it better to launch early than to wait until your product feels "done"?
            options:
              - Because users prefer unfinished products
              - Because you learn from real users sooner and avoid building features nobody wants
              - Because Lovable gives you more credits for launching quickly
              - Because search engines rank new products higher
            correctAnswer: 1
            explanation: Launching early lets you learn from real users before investing too much time in features that might not matter. You can always improve based on what you learn. The longer you wait for "perfect," the more time you risk spending on the wrong things.

            options:
              - Plan everything, build everything, launch once
              - Write detailed specifications, then hand them to AI
              - Build fast, ignore feedback, add more features
              - Build one thing, measure the result, learn from it, repeat
            correctAnswer: 3
            explanation: The agile cycle for solo builders is "build, measure, learn, repeat." You build one small feature, check if it works, learn from the result, and then decide what to do next. This keeps you moving forward without getting overwhelmed.
