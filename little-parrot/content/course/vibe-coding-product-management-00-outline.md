# Course Outline: Build a Valuable Product

**Full title:** Build a Valuable Product: How to Break Down Your Idea for Vibe Coding

## Overview

This micro-course helps learners transform a raw app idea into a structured, buildable plan. It moves from problem definition through to a working prompt for an AI app builder like Lovable.

The narrative follows a single thread: start with the user's problem, not the solution. Each module builds on the previous one, gradually adding specificity until the learner has a scoped MVP and a plan to test it.

## Structure

### 1. Craft a Problem Statement
Define what you're solving before jumping to solutions.

- Introduce the problem statement template: I am [user] trying to [outcome], but [barrier] because [root cause], which makes me feel [emotion]
- Example: Book Club Organiser
- Exercise: Write your own problem statement

### 2. Define Your Target User
Create a persona to guide decisions throughout development.

- What a persona is and why it helps
- Template: Name, About, Frustrations, Goals
- Example: Sarah, the overwhelmed book club organiser
- Exercise: Create your persona

### 3. Storyboard: From Struggle to Solution
Visualise the user's journey from problem to happy outcome.

- Three-step storyboard process:
  1. Draw the struggle
  2. Draw the happy ending
  3. Sketch the moments in between
- Example panels for Book Club Organiser
- Exercise: Create each panel for your idea

### 4. Break Down Your Idea Into Buildable Steps
Use story mapping to turn your storyboard into a feature map.

- User story mapping structure:
  - Activities (high-level goals)
  - Steps (what the user does)
  - Details (buildable pieces)
- Example: Book Club Organiser story map
- Exercises: Map activities, steps, and details

### 5. Decide What to Build First: Define Your MVP
Scope down to the smallest version that delivers value.

- What an MVP is (and isn't)
- How to carve out your MVP from the story map
- Example: Book Club Organiser MVP scope
- Exercise: Define your MVP

### 6. Create a Prompt to Build Your MVP with AI
Translate your plan into instructions for an AI app builder.

- Prompt structure: Product Overview, Target User, User Flow, Platform Requirements, Design System
- Example prompt for Book Club Organiser
- Tip: Build iteratively, one feature at a time

### 7. Get Feedback on What You've Built
Plan how to test your idea with real users.

- Why test early
- How to run a simple user test
- What to observe and ask
- Exercise: Plan your first user test

## Narrative Arc

The course follows a narrowing funnel:

1. **Wide:** What problem exists in the world?
2. **Narrower:** Who has this problem most acutely?
3. **Focused:** What does their journey look like?
4. **Detailed:** What features does that journey require?
5. **Scoped:** Which features matter most right now?
6. **Actionable:** How do I tell an AI builder what to make?
7. **Validated:** How do I know if I got it right?

Each module includes a worked example (Book Club Organiser) and a hands-on exercise where learners apply the concept to their own idea.
