              A dalmatian dog (called Dalmie) wearing a red shirt sits at a desk with a laptop, facing
              an orange robot. The robot asks, “Hi Dalmie, what would you like to build today?”

              A **bug** is when your app behaves differently from what you intended. Maybe a button does not respond, data does not save, or the screen shows `"undefined"` instead of real content.

              The term comes from the early days of computing. *Grace Hopper*, a pioneering computer scientist, documented an incident where a moth got stuck inside a computer and caused it to malfunction. The team taped the insect into the logbook and wrote that they had **“debugged”** the machine.

              Today, bugs are simply **mismatches between what you expected and what actually happens.**

              If you’ve ever built something in Lovable and thought, "Why isn't this working?", you’re already debugging.
              Debugging isn’t a sign that you’ve failed, or that you’re not technical enough. It’s simply the process of understanding why your app isn't doing what you expected, and then fixing it.
              Here’s something that might surprise you: even experienced developers spend a massive part of their day fixing things that don't work. Bugs happen to everyone.
              The difference between someone who feels stuck and someone who moves forward isn't being "more technical." It’s knowing what to do when things go wrong.
              That’s exactly what you’ll learn here: how to debug with confidence.
              In this micro-course, you’ll learn to identify different types of bugs, spot their root causes, and investigate properly before jumping into fixes.
              You’ll pick up the same habits professional developers use:
              How to prevent bugs in the first place. How to investigate issues step by step.
              And how to use Lovable’s debugging tools properly, instead of guessing or getting stuck in "fix-break" loops.
              By the end, you’ll have a practical toolkit for troubleshooting. When something breaks, you’ll know where to look, what questions to ask, and exactly how to move forward.
              Bugs will still happen. But they won’t stop you anymore.

              **Debugging** is the process of finding and fixing bugs. It has two parts:

              **1. Investigation:** Understanding what's wrong and why.

              **2. Fixing:** Making changes to solve the problem.

              It's tempting to jump straight to fixing. But experienced developers know that **investigation is the most important part**. If you don't understand the problem, your fix might not work, or might break something else.

              This is true for vibe coding too. Effective debugging in Lovable means knowing how to investigate issues before trying to fix them.

              Not all bugs are the same, and different kinds need different approaches. Here are the main categories you'll encounter:

              - **Launch blockers:** The app will not start or load, and you only see an error message.
              - **Freezes and misbehaviours:** The app starts, but specific features do not work as expected.
              - **Visual glitches:** Things look wrong, such as incorrect colours, or broken layouts.
              - **Security vulnerabilities:** Potential data leaks, unauthorised access threat, or other safety-related issues.

              Once you recognise which type you're dealing with, you'll know where to start fixing it.

              Let's briefly explore each type of bug in the next steps. Some are so easy to fix that we'll cover them in this challenge right away. Others need more depth, so they get their own dedicated challenges later in the course.

          content:
            body: |-
              Launch blockers prevent your app from starting at all. In technical terms, these are known as **build errors** or **compile-time errors**.

              Build or compile time refers to the process of transforming your app’s code into a runnable program. If errors occur during this process, the app will not launch.

            body: |-
              These errors can look intimidating, but they usually come with clear messages explaining what went wrong. Common causes include syntax errors, missing files, or incompatible code.

              Because these instructions are explicit and easy to interpret, and because AI is well suited to reading them, launch blockers are often the easiest bugs to fix.

              Lovable is even designed to automatically show a **Try to Fix** button when these errors occur, allowing you to resolve them quickly with a single click.

              If it doesn’t show the button, you can always prompt Lovable directly: `"There’s a build error: [paste error message]. Fix it."`

          content:
            body: |-
              These bugs occur when specific features or actions in your app do not work as expected. The app starts, but something goes wrong during use.
              In technical terms, these are often called **runtime errors** or **logical errors**.

              Runtime refers to when the app is running, and logical errors mean the code runs but produces incorrect results.

              Examples include:
              - A button that does nothing when clicked
              - Data that fails to save or load correctly
              - Features that behave inconsistently or unpredictably

              These bugs can be trickier to figure out because they don't always produce clear error messages. They often need some careful detective work to understand what's really going on.

              These are the most common bugs you'll run into, so we'll dedicate an entire challenge to investigating and fixing them. You'll feel much more confident after that one.

              Visual glitches affect how your app looks. Maybe the colours are off, elements are misaligned, or the layout breaks on certain screens.

              Your app still works, but it doesn't look the way you intended. These are usually the least stressful bugs to deal with.

              In many cases visual glitches are not easily fixed by only prompting Lovable, but
              fortunately you can attach screenshots to your prompts to help Lovable understand exactly
              what is wrong.

              Security vulnerabilities are weaknesses that could expose your app or its data to unauthorised access.

              Your app's features might work perfectly, but if there are gaps in how data is handled or protected, your users' safety could be at risk.

              Even experienced developers keep an eye out for these, because the consequences can be serious.

              Security vulnerabilities can feel intimidating, but Lovable has your back. It includes a **built-in security auditor** that scans your app for potential issues and suggests fixes.

              We'll dedicate an entire challenge in this course to understanding and handling security warnings. By the end, you'll know exactly what to do when they pop up.

              - When the app crashes completely
              - When the app behaves differently from what you intended
              - When users do not like the design
              - When the code is too long
            correctAnswer: 1
            explanation: A bug is any mismatch between what you expect your app to do and what actually happens. It does not have to be a crash. Even small unexpected behaviours count.

            question: Why are build errors often the easiest bugs to fix?
            options:
              - They usually include clear error messages that AI can interpret well
              - They do not affect users
              - They fix themselves after a refresh
              - They only happen once
            correctAnswer: 0
            explanation: Build errors typically provide explicit messages about what went wrong. This makes them well suited for AI-assisted fixes, such as Lovable’s 'Try to Fix' feature.

            options:
              - The app fails to start and shows an error message
              - The layout is slightly off
              - A button does nothing when clicked
              - A missing image in the header
            correctAnswer: 2

            question: What is a helpful way to debug visual glitches in Lovable?
            options:
              - Ignore them if the app works
              - Restart the app repeatedly
              - Prompt Lovable without any extra information
              - Attach screenshots to your prompt
            correctAnswer: 3
            explanation: Visual issues are easier to diagnose when you show Lovable exactly what looks wrong. Screenshots provide important context that text alone may miss.

              The best debugging strategy? **Avoid bugs in the first place!** While you can't prevent every bug, certain habits dramatically reduce how often you get stuck.

              **Think of it like cooking:** it's much easier to add salt gradually and taste as you go than to try to fix an over-salted dish. The same principle applies to building apps.

              One of the most common causes of bugs is asking for too much at once. When you give Lovable a huge, complex prompt, many things can go wrong, and it's hard to know which part caused the problem.

              **Instead of this:**
              "Add voting functionality with a vote button that increases the count, shows who voted, prevents double voting, sends notifications, and displays a leaderboard."

              **Try this:**
              ```Add a Vote button next to each book suggestion that increases the count if pushed.```

              Then **test** if it works as you intended. 

              Then **add the next small piece**.

              When you work in small steps:
              - **Bugs are easier to find.** If something breaks, you know it was the last small change you made.
              - **Bugs are easier to fix.** Less code changed means less to test and undo.
              - **You feel more in control.** Each small win builds confidence.

              Professional developers follow this same pattern. They call it "making small commits:" completing and testing one small piece before moving to the next.

          content:
            body: |-
              After Lovable makes a change, **test it immediately**. Don't wait until you've added five more features.

              **For Dalmie's voting feature, testing means:**
              1. Click the **Vote** button
              2. Does the vote count **increase** on screen?
              3. **Refresh** the page – is the vote **still there**?
              4. Try voting from a **different account**

              If something's wrong, you'll catch it while the change is fresh. Catching bugs early means they're much **easier to fix**.

          content:
            body: |-
              Lovable keeps a history of every change. You can **bookmark** working versions so you can always get back to them.

              **After every working feature:**
              Click the bookmark option to mark that version as stable.

              **Why this matters:**
              If a bug appears later, you have a known good state to return to. You can compare what changed between the working version and the broken one.

              **Pro tip:** If you use bookmarks and something in your app breaks, you can prompt Lovable:

              ```
              Compare the current version to the last bookmarked version. What has changed?
              ```

              ✓ **Test immediately.** After each change, she clicks through her app to make sure it works as expected.

              ✓ **Bookmark when it works.** Each stable version gets bookmarked.

              This simple routine has cut her debugging time dramatically. When bugs do appear, she knows exactly which change caused the issue.

            body: |-
              It’s tempting to cram everything into one big prompt to save credits. In practice, this usually **costs more**.

              Large prompts increase the chance that something goes wrong, which leads to rework and wasted credits.

              Prompting Lovable in **smaller, clearer steps** is often **cheaper** overall. You get more predictable results, spot issues earlier, and avoid messy fixes.

              **Lovable is designed for iterative work.** A bit of back-and-forth while debugging is also normal.

              Don’t avoid building iteratively to “save” credits. A few well-spent credits to build in small steps can save many more later on.

              - To save credits by using fewer messages

              - To make the app run faster
              - To make bugs easier to find and fix
            question: Why is breaking features into small prompts helpful for preventing bugs?
            explanation: When you work in small steps, you always know what changed if something breaks. If a bug appears, it must be from the last small change, making it much easier to find and fix than hunting through a large, complex change. Also it makes sure that Lovable adds less unwanted functionality.

            explanation: Bookmark after every working feature! Each bookmark is a safe point you can return to. If bugs appear later, you'll have clear checkpoints to revert to and can compare what changed between versions.

              You are a debugging mentor for writing applications using AI app builders like Lovable
              evaluating a best practice preventing bugs.

              ## Description for the assignment:

              Dalmie wants to add a comments feature where book club members
              can discuss each book suggestion. What are the best practices she should
              follow to prevent bugs while building this feature?

              ## Context for related content in the course:

              When Dalmie adds a new feature to her Book Club Organiser, she now follows this checklist:

              ✓ **One feature at a time.** First the Vote button. Then the vote count display. Then preventing double votes.

              ✓ **Test immediately.** After each change, she clicks through to make sure it works.

              ✓ **Bookmark when it works.** Each stable version gets bookmarked.

              This simple routine has cut her debugging time dramatically. When bugs do appear, she knows exactly where to look.


              ## Assessment criteria:

              Good answers mention:
              (1) breaking the feature into small, testable parts
              (2) testing each part immediately after addition
              (3) bookmarking stable versions after each successful test. Praise systematic approaches.If they miss key prevention steps, suggest them.
              End with encouragement.

              ## Things to avoid:

              - Do not provide code or implementation details.
              - Don't mention version control systems outside of Lovable's bookmarking feature.
              - Don't mention too much besides the prevention habits taught in this challenge.

              Dalmie is building her Book Club Organiser app in Lovable. Yesterday, everything was working beautifully, members could suggest books for the book club.

              Today, she added a feature to be able to vote on each book. But now when she clicks the Vote button... nothing happens. No error message appears. The vote count doesn't change. The button looks normal.

              Let's shift how we think about bugs:

              **Old mindset:** "Something's broken. I must have done something wrong. Let me ask Lovable to fix it immediately."

              **New mindset:** "Something's not working yet. Let me understand what's happening before I try to fix it."

              The key insight: **diagnose before fixing**. Spending time investigating (rather than immediately attempting fixes) actually gets you to a solution faster.

          content:
            body: |-
              The first question developers ask: is this a **frontend** bug or a **backend** bug?

              Data flows through both parts of your application, so the first step is figuring out which side the problem is on.

              **Frontend bugs** affect what users see:
              - Button doesn't respond to clicks
              - Text shows "undefined" or "NaN" instead of data
              - Layout looks broken
              - Colours or styles are wrong

              **Backend bugs** affect what happens behind the scenes:
              - Data doesn't save
              - User authentication fails
              - Information loads incorrectly
              - Actions succeed on screen but have no real effect

              Different bugs leave clues in different places.

              Beside the clues in the previous step, there are tools and strategies to help you investigate further.
              We need to check each part of the application to see where the problem lies, from the user interface
              (frontend) to the server and database (backend).

          content:
            body: |-
              Your web browser has a secret superpower called **DevTools**. It includes a **Console** where your app writes messages and errors.

              **To open DevTools:**
              - **Windows/Linux:** Press `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`
              - **Mac:** Press `Cmd + Option + I`
              - **Or:** Right-click anywhere on the page → "Inspect"

              Then click the **Console** tab.

              When something goes wrong on the frontend, error messages appear here in red. Even when there's no visible error, the Console might contain clues.

              The **Console** is like a diary for your app. It records:
              - Errors that occur
              - Warnings about potential issues
              - Messages you add the code to check what your app is doing at a specific moment

              Developers (and Lovable) use the Console **to see what went wrong** when bugs appear. Even if nothing seems broken on the screen, the Console might reveal hidden problems.

            body: |-
              When code runs into a problem, it often throws an **error** (also called an **exception**). Errors are like red flags that something went wrong.

              Usually an error looks like this in the Console:

              ```
              Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'title')
                  at renderBook (BookList.js:45)
                  at onClick (VoteButton.js:10)
              ```
              The first line describes the error type and message. The lines below show where in the code the error occurred (called a **stack trace**).

              It can look scary, but you don't need to understand every detail. Knowing that an error occurred is already a big clue, and you can copy and paste it for Lovable.

              In fact, error messages are good news! When you share them with Lovable, it can often fix the problem straight away.

              To see error messages in the Console, you often need to **reproduce the bug** while DevTools is open.

              For Dalmie's Vote button bug:
              1. Open the **app preview** in a new tab
              2. Open **DevTools** (on that tab) and go to the **Console** tab
              3. **Click** the Vote button
              4. Look for any new **error messages** that appear in red

              If an error shows up, copy **the entire message** (including the stack trace) to share with Lovable. This information is crucial for diagnosing and fixing the bug.

          title: The Network tab
          content:
            body: |-
              In the DevTools, there is also a **Network tab**. This shows every request your app makes to the backend.

              Each row is a request. In the **Status** column, look for:
              - **200** – Success, request worked
              - **400, 401, 403, 404, or 500** – Failed, something went wrong

              **Clicking a failed request** shows details about what went wrong. This is especially useful for cases where nothing appears in the Console.

              **Dalmie's discovery:** When her Vote button did nothing, the Network tab showed a red `500` error on the vote request. This means, the backend crashed because something didn't work on the server.

          content:
            body: |-
              The frontend talks to the backend using **HTTP requests**. Each request gets a response with a **status code** indicating success or failure.
              Those numbers on requests (200, 401, etc.) are the **status codes**. Here are the important ones:

              **200** — Success! Everything worked.

              **400** — Bad request. The data sent was wrong or missing something.

              **401** — Not authenticated. The user needs to log in.

              **403** — Forbidden. User is logged in but doesn't have permission.

              **404** — Not found. The thing requested doesn't exist.

              **500** — Server error. Something crashed on the backend.

              The first digit tells you the category: 
              - **2xx = success**, 
              - **4xx = client problem**, 
              - **5xx = server problem**.

              If there is a failed request, it will likely also show up in the Console as an error message.

              If the **Console** and **Network** tabs don't reveal the full issue, it's time to check the backend logs.

              **Backend logs** record what happens on the server side, so you cannot read them in the browser's console.

              In the next step, we'll explore how to access and interpret Lovable's backend logs.

              When your app has backend functions, Lovable Cloud keeps logs of what happens.

              *(As a reminder, backend functions are pieces of code that run on the server to handle tasks like saving data, sending emails, or processing payments.)*

              **How to access the backend logs:**
              1. In Lovable, click the **`+` button** next to Preview
              2. Select the **Cloud tab**
              3. Click **Logs**

              **The logs show:**
              - When backend functions ran
              - What data they received
              - Any errors that occurred (the same type of error messages you saw in the Console)
              - Success or failure messages

              This is where you'll find clues for silent bugs that don't show errors in the browser.

          content:
            body: |-
              In Lovable, in the **Cloud** tab, you can see **function invocations**. They are records of each time a backend function was called.

              You'll see entries like:

              - ✅ `submit-vote` - Success (200)
              - ❌ `submit-vote` - Failed (500)
              - ❌ `submit-vote` - Failed (401)

              This tells you:
              - Was the function called at all? (Maybe the button isn't connected)
              - Did it succeed or fail?
              - What was the status code? (Tells you why it failed)

              Clicking an invocation often shows more details about what went wrong.

              Sometimes the function runs successfully, but data still seems wrong. The next place to check is the **database itself**.

              In the Lovable Cloud tab, you can view your database tables:
              1. Look for the **Database** section
              2. Click on the table you're investigating (e.g., `votes`)
              3. Check if the data you expected is actually there

              **Dalmie's discovery:** Her vote function showed "Success (200)" but votes weren't displaying. She checked the `votes` table and found her votes WERE being saved – but with the wrong `book_id`. The bug was in what data was being sent, not in the saving process!

              When investigating bugs, follow this systematic approach:

              1. **Reproduce the bug** while DevTools is open.
              2. **Check the Console** for frontend errors.
              3. **Check the Network tab** for failed backend requests and status codes.
              4. If needed, **check Lovable Cloud logs** for backend function errors.
              5. Finally, **check the database** to see if data is saved correctly.

              Gathering clues from each of these places helps you pinpoint where the problem lies, making it much easier to fix.

              Not all bugs produce error messages. 😱 Sometimes things just don't work as expected, but
              nothing appears in red.

              In these cases, you can prompt Lovable to add logging statements to your code. These are messages that print out
              internal state at key points, helping Lovable and you understand what's happening.

              After Lovable adds logs, reproduce the bug again and check the Console and Cloud logs for the new messages.

              In your prompt, be specific about what is the expected vs actual behaviour, so Lovable knows what to log.

              Lovable gives you three distinct debugging tools. Using the right one for a specific situation makes all the difference:

              - **Plan mode** – For investigating problems and understanding what's wrong.
              - **Visual edits** – For fixing how things look (colours, text, spacing).
              - **'Try to Fix' button** – For quick automated repairs when errors appear.

              Let's explore each one in depth so you know exactly when to reach for which tool.

          content:
            body: |-
              **Plan mode** or **Plan** transforms Lovable from a code generator into an investigative partner. This is your most powerful debugging tool.

              **How to access it:** Look at the bottom of your screen where you type prompts. You'll see a button that says "Plan". Click it to highlight **Plan** in blue.

              **The key difference:** In Plan mode, Lovable **investigates without changing your code** until you explicitly approve or click the **Plan** button again to switch back to **Agent** mode that writes code. This makes it safe for investigation – you won't accidentally make things worse while exploring.

              Plan mode can autonomously:

              - **Search through your files** to find relevant code
              - **Inspect logs** to see what happened
              - **Query your database** to check if data exists
              - **Reason through multi-step problems** and explain them

              When you describe an issue, Plan mode creates a step-by-step investigation plan. Once you're satisfied with the analysis, an **"Implement the plan"** button appears; clicking it switches to **Agent** mode and applies the fix.

              This **"investigate first, fix second"** approach embodies the debugging mindset!

              Here are investigation prompts that work well:

              **For understanding what's wrong:**
              - ```The Vote button isn't working. Can you investigate what happens when it's clicked?```
              - ```What is the root cause of this error: [paste error from Console or Network tab]?```

              **For getting options before fixing:**
              - ```Investigate but don't write code yet. Suggest 3 possible causes.```
              - ```Take a step back. Analyse the problem and suggest a different approach.```

              **Visual edits** let you click directly on elements in your app preview and change their appearance instantly.

              **How to access it:**
              1. Look at the bottom of your screen where you type prompts
              2. Click the **Visual edits** button
              2. Click on any element in your app you want to change
              3. Type your prompt into the text box that appears

              **Best for:**
              - Changing colours, fonts, sizes
              - Fixing text content
              - Adjusting spacing and layout
              - Quick appearance tweaks

              **Bonus:** To change the text, you just need to click on the paragraph you want to edit in **Visual edits** mode and type the new text. It will cost no credits!

              **Good to know:** Editing text in Visual edits only works on **static elements**.

              - **Static elements** stay the same for everyone: a logo, a heading that says "Welcome", a button labelled "Submit", a paragraph describing your team.
              - **Dynamic elements** change based on data or user state: a list of books from the database, a user's name after login, a vote count that updates.

              **How to tell:** Hover over an element in **Visual edit** mode. If you can't edit the text, it's dynamic.

              For dynamic elements, use **Plan** mode to investigate and fix.
              The design of both static and dynamic elements can be changed in Visual edits mode.

              - Build errors
              - Missing dependencies
              - Error messages in Console or Cloud logs

              **When it doesn't work well:**

              You're stuck in a **bug loop** – each fix attempt makes the codebase more tangled, and you feel like you're going backwards.

              This challenge teaches you specific strategies to escape this frustrating loop, and when to cut your losses and revert to a previous version.

              Here's a crucial lesson from experienced Lovable users: **if your fix attempts aren't working after three tries, stop and change your approach**.

              Each failed fix can make things worse by introducing new changes on top of broken code. You end up in a **bug loop** where fixes create new problems.

              After three attempts:
              - Revert to a previous working version
              - Switch to Plan mode to compare versions
              - Ask Lovable to explain the root cause before making more changes
              - Isolate the problem to one feature at a time
              - Rewrite the feature from scratch if it's too tangled

              We'll learn all these strategies in this course.

              Every response in your chat history has a **revert option** underneath it. This is your emergency brake.

              **How it works:**
              Find the last response where things were working. Click the revert option. Your project goes back to that state. Any changes made after that point are undone.

              **What you don't lose:**
              All the messages and changes after that point remain visible in your history. You can read through them to understand what went wrong.

              **When to use it:**

              ```
              Compare the current version to the last bookmarked version. What changed? What might cause [describe the bug]?
              ```

              **Or:**

              ```
              Compare the code from 3 changes ago to now. List all the differences and which might cause [describe the bug].
              ```

              This surfaces exactly what changed, often revealing the culprit immediately. This is why bookmarking stable versions is so valuable!

              When you're in a loop, stop asking for fixes. Switch to **Plan mode** and ask for explanation:

              ```
              We've been going back and forth on this bug. Before making any more changes, explain what might be the root cause of [explain bug]. I want to understand before we proceed.
              ```

              This forces a step back. You might discover:
              - The approach itself is flawed
              - There's a simpler solution
              - Multiple bugs are tangled together

              ```
              Let's focus only on the Vote button for now. Ignore the vote count display, the leaderboard, and the notifications. Just get the Vote button to successfully save a vote.
              ```

              Once that works, add the next piece. This prevents fixes for one thing from breaking another.

              **Ask yourself:**
              - What's the simplest version of this feature that would work?
              - How can we disregard everything else and test just this one thing?

              If a feature is deeply tangled, sometimes the fastest way forward is to rewrite it from scratch.
              You can **revert** not just before the bugloop started, but all the way back **to before the feature existed**.

              Then, prompt Lovable to build the feature again, but with a different approach or simpler design.

              Because building features with AI builders has become so fast, **rewriting can be quicker than untangling**. It can literally cost fewer credits to start fresh than to spend ages debugging.

          content:
            body: |-
              Structure your debugging prompts like this:

              **1. What you were doing:**
              "I clicked the Vote button on a book suggestion."

              **2. What you expected:**
              "The vote count should increase by 1."

              **3. What actually happened:**
              "Nothing changed on screen."

              **4. The clues you found:**
              "The Network tab shows a 401 error on the vote request."

              **5. What you've tried (if anything):**
              "I tried logging out and back in, but same result."

              This formula works for almost any bug!

            body: |-
              Always mention exactly where the bug happens:

              ❌ "The button doesn't work."

              ✅ "On the `/books` page, the Vote button next to each book suggestion doesn't respond when clicked."

              **Include:**
              - The page URL or name (`/dashboard`, `/books`)
              - The specific component ("the Vote button", "the Add Book form")
              - Any relevant context ("for books with zero votes", "when logged in as a member")

              Vague prompts lead to vague fixes. Specific prompts lead to precise solutions.

              - The navigation component
              - The authentication system
              - The Add Book form"

              **Or more simply:**
              "Fix the voting issue. Only change files related to the vote button, don't touch other components."

              Guardrails keep fixes focused and prevent the bug loops we discussed in the previous challenge.

              1. What data is being sent when the button is clicked
              2. What response comes back from the backend
              3. Any errors that occur"

              **After adding logs:**
              1. Reproduce the bug
              2. Check the Console for the new messages
              3. Share what you've found with Lovable

              On the `/books` page, when I click the Vote button on a book suggestion, nothing happens.

              **Expected:** Vote count increases by 1.

              **Actual:** No change on screen.

              **Clues:** The Network tab shows the vote request returning 401. The Console has no errors. I'm logged in, I can see my name in the header.

              **Tried:** Refreshing the page, logging out and back in, but same result.

              Can you investigate what's causing the 401 error? Please don't modify anything else, just focus on the voting function.
              ```

              This gives Lovable everything needed to investigate and fix effectively.

              But when she clicks **Publish**, Lovable shows her a list of **security issues**. Some are marked as **errors**, others as **warnings**, and a few as **informational tips**.

              Her first reaction? Panic. *"Is my app broken? Did I do something wrong?"*

              The scanner checks different parts of your app, including:

              **1. Your database settings:** Are your data tables protected so only the right people can access them?

              **2. Your authentication settings:** Are your login and signup features configured safely?

              **3. Your code:** Does your code accidentally expose sensitive information?

              Here's something most security guides won't tell you: **not every security warning matters equally for every app**.

              The **severity** of a security issue depends on what your app does and who uses it:

              **Personal tool** (just for you): A to-do list only you use? Most security warnings are low priority. There's no sensitive user data to protect beyond your own.

              **Internal team tool** (for your company or club): Dalmie's Book Club Organiser with 15 trusted members? Medium priority. You want basic protections, but the risk is lower than a public app.

              **Public app** (for anyone on the internet): A marketplace where strangers sign up and share personal data? High priority. Every security warning deserves attention.

              This doesn't mean you should ignore warnings for personal tools. But it helps you **prioritise** what to fix first and how urgently.

              The security warning you'll see most often is about **Row Level Security**, or **RLS** for short.

              Your app stores data in database tables (think of them like spreadsheets). Each row is a piece of data: a user's profile, a book suggestion, or a vote on a book.

              **RLS is a set of rules that controls who can see and change each row.** Without these rules, the data in that table has no protection.

              Here's the tricky part: **your app might look completely fine.** When Dalmie uses her Book Club Organiser, she only sees her own data. Everything works as expected. **So what's the problem?**

              Behind the scenes, your app's database has a public address and a public key (called the `anon` key) that are embedded in your app's code. These are visible to anyone.

              **Without RLS, someone who finds these** (which is easy) **can bypass your app entirely and read all the data in your tables directly.** Not through your app's interface, but by talking to the database itself.

              Imagine a stranger reading every member's email address, book preferences, and voting history from Dalmie's book club, without ever opening the app. That's what missing RLS makes possible.

              When Lovable flags an RLS warning, it means one of your database tables **doesn't have rules about who can access what**.

              The good news: Lovable can fix most RLS issues for you.

              **Step 1:** In the security findings, open the RLS warning and ask Lovable to *"Add Row Level Security policies."* in the inline chat within the Security view or click the **Try to fix all** button to tackle all the identified issues.

              **Step 2:** Lovable will **add policies** that typically restrict each user to only see and modify their own data.

              **Step 3:** **Run the security scan again** to confirm the warning is gone. If Lovable's scanner no longer flags the table, the policies are in place.

              **Missing security headers:** Your app's server isn't sending certain instructions to the browser about how to behave securely. For example, the browser might not know to block malicious scripts from running or to force secure (HTTPS) connections.

              **Client-side only authentication:** Your app checks whether a user is logged in on the frontend, but the server doesn't double-check. This means someone with basic technical knowledge could bypass login entirely and access your data directly.

              **Missing email verification:** Users can sign up and access your app without confirming their email address, which means anyone could create an account using someone else's email.

              **For client-side only authentication:**
              ```
              Make sure authentication is verified on the server side too, not just in the frontend components. Add checks to all API routes and backend functions.
              ```

              **For missing email verification:** Enable it in your authentication settings and prompt Lovable to add a verification step to the signup flow.

              - Authentication configuration (password checks, OTP expiry)
              - Missing email verification
              - Client-side only authentication

              **Fix for public apps (high priority):**
              - All security headers
              - All infrastructure warnings
              - Every finding flagged as "Error"

              When in doubt, fix it. A few extra minutes of security configuration can save a lot of trouble later.

            question: Dalmie's Book Club Organiser is used by 15 trusted friends. She sees a warning about missing security headers. What should she do?
            options:
              - Ignore all security warnings since it's just for friends
              - Fix it immediately, it's critical
              - Review it but prioritise fixing RLS and exposed keys first
              - Rewrite the app from scratch
            correctAnswer: 2
            explanation: For a small internal app, RLS and exposed keys are the highest priority. Security headers are worth fixing too, but they are less urgent when the app is only used by a small group of trusted people.

            question: What does "client-side only authentication" mean?
            options:
              - The app doesn't have a login feature
              - Login only works on mobile devices
              - The server doesn't verify whether users are actually logged in
              - The login page has a visual bug
            correctAnswer: 2
            explanation: Client-side only authentication means the app checks login status in the browser, but the server doesn't double-check. Someone could bypass the frontend entirely and access data directly through the server.

              Dalmie's Book Club Organiser is ready to publish. The security scanner shows these findings:

              1. Error: RLS not enabled on the "members" table
              2. Warning: Leaked password protection is disabled
              3. Info: Missing X-Frame-Options header
              4. Warning: An API key for her email service is visible in the frontend code

              She wants to share the app with her 15 book club members. Which warnings should she fix first, and why? Are there any she could address later?

              You are a security mentor for learners building applications with Lovable. Evaluate the learner's prioritisation of security findings.

              Good answers should prioritise: (1) the exposed API key because it gives anyone access to her email service, (2) RLS on the members table because it protects personal data, (3) leaked password protection as a good security practice, and (4) the X-Frame-Options header as lower priority for a small internal app. Accept reasonable variations in ordering between items 1 and 2 since both are critical. Praise clear reasoning about why certain issues are more urgent. If they miss key priorities, explain why exposed keys and missing RLS are the top concerns. End with encouragement.
            checkerPrompt: This is a prioritisation exercise for four security findings in a small internal app.

              ✓ **The debugging mindset:** Diagnose before fixing, follow the three-attempt rule, and recognise different types of bugs.

              ✓ **Prevention habits:** Small prompts, immediate testing, and bookmarking stable versions.

              ✓ **Investigation techniques:** Browser Console, Network tab, Lovable Cloud logs, and database checking.

              ✓ **Lovable's toolkit:** Plan mode for investigation, Visual edits for appearance, and Try to Fix for clear errors.

              ✓ **Escape strategies:** Revert, compare versions, explain before fixing, isolate problems, and know when to start fresh.

              ✓ **Effective communication:** The debugging prompt formula, guardrails, specificity, and asking for logs.

              ✓ **Security awareness:** Understanding RLS, authentication settings, and infrastructure security. Knowing what to prioritise based on your app's context.

              **Remember:** Every professional developer debugs constantly and takes security seriously. You now have the same toolkit they use. The bugs will come, but so will the fixes. Happy building! 💪
