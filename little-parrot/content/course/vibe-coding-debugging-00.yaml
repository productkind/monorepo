        body: |-
          A **bug** is when your app behaves differently from what you intended. Maybe a button does not respond, data does not save, or the screen shows `"undefined"` instead of real content.

          The term comes from the early days of computing. *Grace Hopper*, a pioneering computer scientist, documented an incident where a moth got stuck inside a computer and caused it to malfunction. The team taped the insect into the logbook and wrote that they had **“debugged”** the machine.

          Today, bugs are simply **mismatches between what you expected and what actually happens.**

          THIS WILL BE THE VIDEO
          When you build applications with AI app builders, things will sometimes break. Debugging is simply
          the process of finding and fixing those problems. In this micro-lesson, you’ll learn practical
          techniques and core concepts to help you troubleshoot issues in AI-built applications. By the end,
          you’ll be able to recognise common problems, identify their root causes, and fix them more
          effectively. Here’s something professional developers know well: bugs happen to everyone. Even
          experienced engineers spend much of their time fixing things that do not work as expected. Progress
          is not about being “technical enough”. It’s about knowing what to do when things go wrong or prevent
          them occurring on the first place. That’s exactly what this micro-course is designed to teach.

      title: What is debugging?

        body: |-
          **Debugging** is the process of finding and fixing bugs. It has two parts:

          **1. Investigation:** Understanding what's wrong and why.

          **2. Fixing:** Making changes to solve the problem.

          Many beginners jump straight to fixing. But experienced developers know that **investigation is the most important part**. If you don't understand the problem, your fix might not work, or might break something else.

          This is true for vibe coding too! Effective debugging in Lovable means knowing how to investigate issues before trying to fix them.

      title: Types of bugs
      content:
        body: |-
          Bugs can be categorised in many ways. For our purposes, it makes sense to categorise them based on the action needed to fix them.

          Bugs typically fall into a few common categories:

          - **Launch blockers:** The app will not start or load, and you only see an error message.
          - **Freezes and misbehaviours:** The app starts, but specific features do not work as expected.
          - **Visual glitches:** Things look wrong, such as incorrect colours, or broken layouts.
          - **Security vulnerabilities:** Potential data leaks, unauthorised access threat, or other safety-related issues.

          Understanding these different scenarios can help you fix these bugs more quickly.

          Let ’s briefly explore each type of bug in the next steps. Some of them are so easy to
          fix that we cover them in the challenge right away, but others require more depth so
          there is going to be a dedicated challenge later in the course.

    - type: text
      title: "Types of bugs: Launch blockers"
      content:
        body: |-
          Launch blockers prevent your app from starting at all. In technical terms, these are known as **build errors** or **compile-time errors**.

          Build or compile time refers to the process of transforming your app’s code into a runnable program. If errors occur during this process, the app will not launch.

      title: "Types of bugs: Launch blockers"
      content:
        body: |-
          These errors can look intimidating, but they usually come with clear messages explaining what went wrong. Common causes include syntax errors, missing files, or incompatible code.

          Because these instructions are explicit and easy to interpret, and because AI is well suited to reading them, launch blockers are often the easiest bugs to fix.

          Lovable is even designed to automatically show a **Try to Fix** button when these errors occur, allowing you to resolve them quickly with a single click.

          If it doesn’t show the button, you can always prompt Lovable directly: `"There’s a build error: [paste error message]. Fix it."`

      title: "Types of bugs: Freezes and misbehaviours"
      content:
        body: |-
          These bugs occur when specific features or actions in your app do not work as expected. The app starts, but something goes wrong during use.
          In technical terms, these are often called **runtime errors** or **logical errors**.
          Runtime refers to when the app is running, and logical errors mean the code runs but produces incorrect results.

          Examples include:
          - A button that does nothing when clicked
          - Data that fails to save or load correctly
          - Features that behave inconsistently or unpredictably

          These bugs can be trickier to diagnose because they may not produce clear error messages. They often require careful investigation to understand the root cause.

          In this course, we'll focus heavily on these types of bugs, as they are the most common and challenging to resolve effectively.

        body: |-
          Visual glitches affect the appearance of your app. These bugs may involve incorrect colours, misaligned elements, or broken layouts.

          While they may not impact functionality directly, visual glitches can harm user experience and make your app look unprofessional.

        body: |-
          Security vulnerabilities are bugs that could potentially expose your app or its data to unauthorized access or malicious attacks.

          The features of your app could work perfectly well, but if there are weaknesses in how data is handled or protected, users' safety could be at risk.

          Software developers are auditing their code for security vulnerabilities all the time, as these problems can have serious consequences.

          - They do not affect users
          - They fix themselves after a refresh
          - They only happen once

      content:
        question: Which of the following is an example of a freeze or misbehaviour?
        options:
          - The app fails to start and shows an error message
          - The layout colours are slightly off
          - A button does nothing when clicked
          - A missing image in the header
        correctAnswer: 2
        explanation: Freezes and misbehaviours happen at runtime. The app starts, but specific features do not behave as expected.

          - Ignore them if the app works
          - Restart the app repeatedly
          - Prompt Lovable without any extra information
          - Attach screenshots to your prompt
        correctAnswer: 3

      title: The small prompt habit
      content:
        body: |-
          One of the most common causes of bugs is asking for too much at once. When you give Lovable a huge, complex prompt, many things can go wrong, and it's hard to know which part caused the problem.

          **Instead of this:**
          "Add voting functionality with a vote button that increases the count, shows who voted, prevents double voting, sends notifications, and displays a leaderboard."

          **Try this:**
          "Add a Vote button next to each book suggestion that increases the count if pushed."

          Then test. Then add the next small piece.
      subtitle: One thing at a time
    - type: text
      title: Why small prompts work
      content:
        body: |-
          When you work in small steps:

          **Bugs are easier to find.** If something breaks, you know it was the last small change you made.

          **Bugs are easier to fix.** Less code changed means less to test and undo.

          **You feel more in control.** Each small win builds confidence.

          Professional developers follow this same pattern. They call it "making small commits" – completing and testing one small piece before moving to the next.
      subtitle: The wisdom behind the habit
    - type: text
      title: Test after every change
      content:
        body: |-
          After Lovable makes a change, **test it immediately**. Don't wait until you've added five more features.

          For Dalmie's voting feature, testing means:
          1. Click the Vote button
          2. Does the vote count increase on screen?
          3. Refresh the page – is the vote still there?
          4. Try voting from a different account

          If something's wrong, you'll catch it while the change is fresh. Catching bugs early means they're much easier to fix.

      title: Bookmark your stable versions
      content:
        body: |-
          Lovable keeps a history of every change. You can **bookmark** working versions so you can always get back to them.

          **After every working feature:**
          Click the bookmark option to mark that version as stable.

          **Why this matters:**
          If a bug appears later, you have a known good state to return to. You can compare what changed between the working version and the broken one.

          **Pro tip:** After bookmarking, you can prompt Lovable:
          "Compare the current version to the last bookmarked version. What changed?"

          ✓ **One feature at a time.** First the Vote button. Then the vote count display. Then preventing double votes.

          ✓ **Test immediately.** After each change, she clicks through to make sure it works.

          ✓ **Bookmark when it works.** Each stable version gets bookmarked.

          This simple routine has cut her debugging time dramatically. When bugs do appear, she knows exactly where to look.

        body: |-
          You might worry about using credits while building and debugging. Here's some perspective:

          **Building iteratively is normal.** Lovable's pricing accounts for back-and-forth conversation.

          Even if you spend credits on several conversations to fix a bug, compare that to hiring a developer at $50-150 per hour. A debugging session that costs a few credits is incredibly cost-effective!

          Don't let credit concerns stop you from proper testing and investigation. A few credits spent finding the root cause can save many more wasted on repeated failed fixes.

          Also, if you follow the prevention habits, you'll use fewer credits overall by avoiding complex bugs.

      title: 'Quiz: Small prompts'
      content:
        options:
        - To save credits by using fewer messages
        - Because Lovable can't handle complex prompts

        - To make bugs easier to find and fix
        question: Why is breaking features into small prompts helpful for preventing
          bugs?
        explanation: When you work in small steps, you always know what changed if
          something breaks. If a bug appears, it must be from the last small change
          — making it much easier to find and fix than hunting through a large, complex
          change. Also it makes sure that Lovable adds less unwanted functionality.

        question: When should you bookmark a stable version?
        explanation: Bookmark after every working feature! Each bookmark is a safe
          point you can return to. If bugs appear later, you'll have clear checkpoints
          to revert to and can compare what changed between versions.

          Dalmie wants to add a comments feature where book club members
          can discuss each book suggestion. What are the best practices she should
          follow to prevent bugs while building this feature?

          ## Context for related content in the course:

          When Dalmie adds a new feature to her Book Club Organiser, she now follows this checklist:

          ✓ **One feature at a time.** First the Vote button. Then the vote count display. Then preventing double votes.

          This simple routine has cut her debugging time dramatically. When bugs do appear, she knows exactly where to look.


          ## Assessment criteria:

          Good answers mention:
          (1) breaking the feature into small, testable parts
          (2) testing each part immediately after addition
          (3) bookmarking stable versions after each successful test. Praise systematic approaches.If they miss key prevention steps, suggest them.
          End with encouragement.

          ## Things to avoid:

          - Do not provide code or implementation details.
          - Don't mention version control systems outside of Lovable's bookmarking feature.
          - Don't mention too much besides the prevention habits taught in this challenge.

          - Text shows "undefined" or "NaN" instead of data
          - Layout looks broken
          - Colours or styles are wrong

          **Backend bugs** affect what happens behind the scenes:
          - Data doesn't save
          - User authentication fails
          - Information loads incorrectly
          - Actions succeed on screen but have no real effect

          Different bugs leave clues in different places.

          Beside the clues in the previous step, there are tools and strategies to help you investigate further.
          We need to check each part of the application to see where the problem lies, from the user interface
          (frontend) to the server and database (backend).

      title: 'Frontend logs: The browser Console'
      content:
        body: |-
          Your web browser has a secret superpower called **DevTools**. It includes a **Console** where your app writes messages and errors.

          **To open DevTools:**
          - **Windows/Linux:** Press `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`
          - **Mac:** Press `Cmd + Option + I`
          - **Or:** Right-click anywhere on the page → "Inspect" → click "Console" tab

          When something goes wrong on the frontend, error messages appear here in red. Even when there's no visible error, the Console might contain clues.

      subtitle: Where frontend errors appear
    - type: text
      title: What is the Console?
      content:
        body: |-
          The Console is like a diary for your app. It records:
          - Errors that occur
          - Warnings about potential issues
          - Debug messages from the code

          Developers (and Lovable) use the Console to see what went wrong when bugs appear. Even if nothing seems broken on screen, the Console might reveal hidden problems.
      subtitle: The app's diary of events
    - type: text
      title: Errors in software
      content:
        body: |-
          When code runs into a problem, it often throws an **error**, or also known as **Exception**. Errors are like red flags that something went wrong.

          Usually an error looks like this in the Console:

          ```
          Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'title')
              at renderBook (BookList.js:45)
              at onClick (VoteButton.js:10)
          ```
          The first line describes the error type and message. The lines below show where in the code the error occurred (called a **stack trace**).

          It can look scary, but you do not need to understand every detail. Simply knowing that an
          error occurred is already a big clue. We are even happy to see it, because when we pass
          the error message to Lovable, it can often fix the problem straight away.

      title: Errors are you friend

        body: |-
          We advise you to read error messages carefully. They are your friends when debugging. At
          first, they may seem like gibberish, but there is a good chance they already contain
          hints that help you understand what is wrong. Over time, you will also get better at
          reading error messages as you practise more.
    - type: text
      title: How to produce the error messages
      content:
        body: |-
          To see error messages in the Console, you often need to **reproduce the bug** while DevTools is open.

          For Dalmie's Vote button bug:
          1. Open the app preview in a new tab
          2. Open DevTools (on that tab) and go to the Console tab
          3. Click the Vote button
          4. Look for any new error messages that appear in red

          If an error shows up, copy the entire message (including the stack trace) to share with Lovable. This information is crucial for diagnosing and fixing the bug.
    - type: text
      title: The Network tab
      content:
        body: |-
          Next to the Console in DevTools is the **Network tab**. This shows every request your app makes to the backend.

          Each row is a request. Look for:
          - **Default color (200)** — Success, request worked
          - **Red (400, 401, 403, 404, 500)** — Failed, something went wrong

          Clicking a failed request shows details about what went wrong. This is especially useful for cases where nothing appears in the Console.

          **Dalmie's discovery:** When her Vote button did nothing, the Console was empty. But the Network tab showed a red `401` error on the vote request – the backend was rejecting her request because she wasn't properly logged in!

    - type: text
      title: HTTP status codes
      content:
        body: |-
          The frontend talks to the backend using **HTTP requests**. Each request gets a response with a **status code** indicating success or failure.
          Those numbers on requests (200, 401, etc.) are the **status codes**. Here are the important ones:

          **200** — Success! Everything worked.

          **400** — Bad request. The data sent was wrong or missing something.

          **401** — Not authenticated. The user needs to log in.

          **403** — Forbidden. User is logged in but doesn't have permission.

          **404** — Not found. The thing requested doesn't exist.

          **500** — Server error. Something crashed on the backend.

          The first digit tells you the category: 2xx = success, 4xx = client problem, 5xx = server problem.

      title: Investigate further
      content:
        body: |-
          If the Console and Network tab don't reveal the full issue, it's time to check the backend logs.

          Backend logs record what happens on the server side, so you cannot read it in the browser's console.

          In the next step, we'll explore how to access and interpret Lovable's backend logs.

      title: 'Backend logs: Lovable Cloud'
      content:
        body: |-
          When your app has backend functions, Lovable Cloud keeps logs of what happens.

          **How to access logs:**
          1. In Lovable, click the **`+` button** next to Preview
          2. Select the **Cloud tab**
          3. Click **Logs**

          The logs show:
          - When backend functions ran
          - What data they received
          - Any errors that occurred (the same type of error messages you saw in the Console)
          - Success or failure messages

          This is where you'll find clues for silent bugs that don't show errors in the browser.

      subtitle: Behind-the-scenes clues
    - type: text
      title: Function invocations
      content:
        body: |-
          In the Cloud tab, you can see **function invocations** – a record of each time a backend function was called.

          You'll see entries like:

          ✅ `submit-vote` - Success (200)
          ❌ `submit-vote` - Failed (500)
          ❌ `submit-vote` - Failed (401)

          This tells you:
          - Was the function called at all? (Maybe the button isn't connected)
          - Did it succeed or fail?
          - What was the status code? (Tells you why it failed)

          Clicking an invocation often shows more details about what went wrong.

      title: Checking your database
      content:
        body: |-
          Sometimes the function runs successfully, but data still seems wrong. The next place to check is the **database itself**.

          In the Lovable Cloud tab, you can view your database tables:
          1. Look for the **Database** section
          2. Click on the table you're investigating (e.g., `votes`)
          3. Check if the data you expected is actually there

          **Dalmie's discovery:** Her vote function showed "Success (200)" but votes weren't displaying. She checked the `votes` table and found her votes WERE being saved – but with the wrong `book_id`. The bug was in what data was being sent, not in the saving process!

          When investigating bugs, follow this systematic approach:

          1. **Reproduce the bug** while DevTools is open.
          2. **Check the Console** for frontend errors.
          3. **Check the Network tab** for failed backend requests and status codes.
          4. If needed, **check Lovable Cloud logs** for backend function errors.
          5. Finally, **check the database** to see if data is saved correctly.

          Gathering clues from each of these places helps you pinpoint where the problem lies, making it much easier to fix.

          Not all bugs produce error messages 😱. Sometimes things just don't work as expected, but
          nothing appears in red.

          In these cases, you can prompt Lovable to add logging statements to your code. These are messages that print out
          internal state at key points, helping lovable and you understand what's happening.

          After lovable adds logs, reproduce the bug again and check the Console and Cloud logs for the new messages.

          In your prompt, be specific about what is the expected vs actual behaviour, so lovable knows what to log.

          communication — which the Network tab will reveal. She might see a failed

          Lovable gives you three distinct debugging tools. Using the right one for the situation makes all the difference:

          - **Chat mode** — For investigating problems and understanding what's wrong.
          - **Visual edits** — For fixing how things look (colours, text, spacing).
          - **'Try to Fix' button** — For quick automated repairs when errors appear.

          Let's explore each one in depth so you know exactly when to reach for which tool.

          **Chat mode** transforms Lovable from a code generator into an investigative partner. This is your most powerful debugging tool.

          **How to access it:** Look at the bottom of your screen where you type prompts. You'll see a button that says "Chat". Click it to highlight **Chat** in blue.

          **The key difference:** In Chat mode, Lovable **investigates without changing your code** until you explicitly approve or click the **Chat** button again to switch back to **Agent** mode that writes code. This makes it safe for investigation – you won't accidentally make things worse while exploring.

          Chat mode can autonomously:

          - **Search through your files** to find relevant code
          - **Inspect logs** to see what happened
          - **Query your database** to check if data exists
          - **Reason through multi-step problems** and explain them

          When you describe an issue, Chat mode creates a step-by-step investigation plan. Once you're satisfied with the analysis, an **"Implement the plan"** button appears – clicking it switches to **Agent** mode and applies the fix.

          This "investigate first, fix second" approach embodies the debugging mindset!

          - "What is the root cause of this error: [paste error from Console or Network tab]?"

          **For getting options before fixing:**
          - "Investigate but don't write code yet. Suggest 3 possible causes."

        explanation: Book titles that come from the database are dynamic elements
          – they change based on data. Visual edits only work on static elements like
          fixed headings or labels. Dalmie would need Chat mode to modify how dynamic
          titles are displayed.

          The most frustrating experience: you try to fix something, but your fix breaks something else. So you fix that, which breaks the first thing again...

          You're stuck in a **bug loop** – each fix attempt makes the codebase more tangled, and you feel like you're going backwards.

          This challenge teaches you specific strategies to escape, and when to cut your losses and revert to a previous version.

      title: The three-attempt rule
      content:
        body: |-
          Here's a crucial lesson from experienced Lovable users: **if your fix attempts aren't working after three tries, stop and change your approach**.

          Each failed fix can make things worse by introducing new changes on top of broken code. You end up in a "bug loop" where fixes create new problems.

          After three attempts:
          - Stop trying the same approach
          - Investigate more deeply
          - Try a completely different strategy
          - Consider reverting to a working version

          We'll learn all these strategies in this course.

    - type: text
      title: 'Strategy 1: The revert button'
      content:
        body: |-
          Every response in your chat history has a **revert option** underneath it. This is your emergency brake.

          **How it works:**
          Find the last response where things were working. Click the revert option. Your project goes back to that state.

          **What you don't lose:**
          All the messages and changes after that point remain visible in your history. You can read through them to understand what went wrong, or selectively re-apply good changes.

          **When to use it:**
          When you've made 3+ fix attempts and things are getting worse, not better.

          If you're not sure what change caused the problem, ask Lovable to compare:

          "Compare the current version to the last bookmarked version. What changed? What might be breaking?"

          **Or:**

          "Compare the code from 3 changes ago to now. List all the differences and which might cause [describe the bug]."

          This surfaces exactly what changed, often revealing the culprit immediately. This is why bookmarking stable versions is so valuable!

      title: 'Strategy 3: Explain before fixing'
      content:

          When you're in a loop, stop asking for fixes. Switch to Chat mode and ask for explanation:

          "We've been going back and forth on this bug. Before making any more changes, explain what's broken and what you would change. I want to understand before we proceed."

          This forces a step back. You might discover:
          - The approach itself is flawed
          - There's a simpler solution
          - Multiple bugs are tangled together

          **Power prompt for persistent issues:**
          "The same problem keeps happening. Do NOT make any code changes yet. Investigate thoroughly to find the exact root cause."

      title: 'Strategy 4: Isolate the problem'
      content:
        body: |-
          Sometimes bugs are tangled together. Untangle them by isolating:

          "Let's focus only on the Vote button for now. Ignore the vote count display, the leaderboard, and the notifications. Just get the Vote button to successfully save a vote."

          Once that works, add the next piece. This prevents fixes for one thing from breaking another.

          **Ask yourself:**
          - What's the simplest version of this feature that would work?
          - Can we disable everything else and test just this one thing?

      title: 'Strategy 5: Rewrite the feature'
      content:
        body: |-
          If a feature is deeply tangled, sometimes the fastest way forward is to rewrite it from scratch.
          You can revert not just before the bugloop started, but all the way back to before the feature existed.

          Then, prompt Lovable to build the feature again, but with a different approach or simpler design.

          Because building features with AI builders got so fast and cheap, rewriting can be quicker than untangling.
          It is literally less credits to start fresh than to spend hours debugging, not just compared to a developer.

      title: 'Strategy 6: Know when to start fresh'
      content:
        body: |-
          Sometimes the kindest thing is to start over. Lovable's **Remix** option (in Project Settings) creates a clean copy.

          **Signs it's time for a fresh start:**
          - You've been stuck on the same bug for an hour+
          - Multiple interconnected bugs keep appearing
          - Lovable's responses are becoming repetitive and unhelpful
          - You've lost track of what's broken
          - You haven't invested that much time yet

          **The liberating truth:**
          Experienced users report that rebuilding with better prompts takes far less time than expected. Everything you learned from the first attempt makes the second much faster.
