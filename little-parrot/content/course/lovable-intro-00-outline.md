# Course Outline: Build Your First App with Lovable

**Full title:** Build Your First App with Lovable

## Overview

This micro-course takes complete beginners from zero to a published web app using Lovable. Within the first challenge, learners write their first prompt and see real output. By the end, they'll have a working app live on the internet.

**The transformation:** You'll go from "I've never built anything" to "I just shipped my first app." You'll understand how to prompt Lovable, navigate its interface, handle common issues, and publish your work. More importantly, you'll have the confidence to keep building.

**What you'll be able to do after this course:**
- Write structured prompts that get you closer to what you want on the first try
- Use Lovable's interface confidently: preview, edit, bookmark, revert
- Handle security warnings without panic
- Publish your app and share it with others
- Know when to start over vs when to iterate

## Structure

### 1. Your First Prompt (Free Challenge)
Build something real in the first five minutes.

**Hook:** You're about to build a working app. No code. No setup. Just words.

- Open Lovable and write your first prompt (guided, simple example)
- See instant output: the "aha!" moment
- What just happened: Lovable translated your words into a working interface
- What vibe coding is: building by describing, not by writing code
- What Lovable produces: web apps that run in browsers (mobile and desktop)
- Exercise: Tweak your prompt and see what changes

**Aha moment:** You described something in plain English, and it exists now. That feeling of "wait, I made that?" is the hook.

### 2. Write Prompts That Work
Learn the structure that gets better results.

- Why vague prompts get vague results
- The prompt formula: Product Overview, User Flow, Platform Requirements, Design System
- Example: Building the Book Club Organiser step by step
- Mobile-first and accessibility: two lines that improve every app
- Exercise: Write a structured prompt for your own idea (or use the Book Club example)
- Tip: Credits are based on complexity; detailed prompts often use fewer credits than vague ones followed by fixes

### 3. Navigate the Lovable Interface
Find your way around without getting lost.

- Preview mode: see your app full-screen, test on mobile
- Code view: you don't need to understand it, but it's there
- Visual edits: click elements to change text, colours, spacing
- Adding assets: images, logos, and where they live
- Design themes: quick ways to change the overall look
- Exercise: Make three visual edits to your app without prompting

### 4. Save Your Progress (and Undo Mistakes)
Protect your work and experiment freely.

- Bookmarking versions: save before risky changes
- Reverting: how to go back when something breaks
- The rebuild mindset: it's cheap to start over, so experiment boldly
- When to revert vs when to rebuild from scratch
- Exercise: Bookmark your current version, try something risky, then revert

### 5. Go Beyond the Interface
Connect your app to real functionality.

- Planning mode: let Lovable think through complex features before building
- Knowledge files: give Lovable context it can reference
- API keys and the Secrets panel: where to put them, why never in prompts
- Lovable Cloud: backend features without setup
- Handling security warnings: what they mean and how to respond
- Exercise: Enable planning mode and ask Lovable to add a feature

### 6. Publish Your App
Put your work on the internet.

- Before you publish: favicon, meta tags, thumbnail (the details that matter)
- The publish button: what happens when you click it
- Your published URL: it's live, but nobody will find it unless you share it
- Why "not done" is fine: ship early, learn from real use
- Products vs projects: apps are never finished, they evolve
- Exercise: Set your favicon and meta tags, then publish
- What to do next: share with one person and ask what confused them

## Narrative Arc

The course follows a confidence progression:

1. **Proof:** I can make something appear (first prompt)
2. **Control:** I can shape what it looks like (prompt structure, visual edits)
3. **Safety:** I can experiment without losing work (bookmarks, reverts)
4. **Depth:** I can add real functionality (planning mode, APIs, cloud)
5. **Shipping:** I can put it in the world (publish, share, iterate)

Each challenge builds on the previous. Learners always have something working; each step makes it better.

## Running Example

The **Book Club Organiser** appears throughout as a worked example:
- Challenge 1: Simple first prompt to create the basic app
- Challenge 2: Structured prompt with the full formula
- Challenge 3: Visual edits to refine the design
- Challenge 4: Bookmark before adding voting feature
- Challenge 5: Add a feature using planning mode
- Challenge 6: Publish and share with a friend

Learners can follow along with this example or apply each concept to their own idea.

## Teaching Approach

- **Hands-on from minute one:** First prompt happens immediately, not after explanation
- **Mindset woven into practice:** "It's cheap to rebuild" taught while they're bookmarking, not in a separate lesson
- **Show the interface:** Screenshots and screen recordings of actual Lovable UI
- **Normalise imperfection:** Encourage publishing before it's "ready"
- **Link to other courses:** Debugging, software basics, and product planning courses referenced where relevant

## Skills Covered

- Prompt writing (structured formula, iteration)
- Lovable interface (preview, code view, visual edits, assets, themes)
- Version control (bookmarking, reverting)
- Backend basics (planning mode, knowledge files, API keys, Lovable Cloud)
- Publishing (favicon, meta tags, deployment)

## Timing

Total estimated time: ~45 minutes (designed so learners have a published app by the end)
