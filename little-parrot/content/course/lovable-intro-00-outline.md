# Course Outline: Build Your First App with Lovable

**Full title:** Build Your First App with Lovable

## Overview

This micro-course takes complete beginners from zero to a published web app using Lovable. Within the first challenge, learners write their first prompt and see real output. By the end, they'll have a working app live on the internet.

**The transformation:** You'll go from "I've never built anything" to "I just shipped my first app." You'll understand how to prompt Lovable, navigate its interface, handle common issues, and publish your work. You'll also have the confidence to keep building.

**What you'll be able to do after this course:**
- Write structured prompts that get you closer to what you want on the first try
- Use Lovable's interface confidently: preview, edit, bookmark, revert
- Handle security warnings calmly
- Publish your app and share it with others
- Know when to start over vs when to iterate

## Structure

### 1. Your First Prompt (Free Challenge)
Build working software in the first few minutes.

**Hook:** You're about to build a working app. No code. No setup. Just words and a structure that works.

- What vibe coding is: building by describing, not by writing code
- What Lovable produces: web apps that run in browsers (mobile and desktop)
- Why structure matters: vague prompts get vague results
- The prompt formula:
    ```markdown
    ## Product overview
    ## User flow
    ## Platform Requirements
    - It's a mobile-first platform. Optimise layout, font sizes, and buttons for mobile. Prioritise speed and readability.
    - The platform is accessible. Implement WCAG AA compliance.
    ## Design system
    - Brand colours
    - Heading font
    - Paragraph font
    - Logo
    ## Implementation details
    ## Target user
    ```
- Example: The Book Club Organiser prompt (learners can use this or adapt for their own idea)
- Exercise: Open Lovable, paste your structured prompt, and hit enter
- See instant output

### 2. Iterate and Improve
Build in small steps; test after each one.

- Credits are based on complexity; detailed prompts often use fewer credits than vague ones followed by fixes
- Prompt in small steps: describe one feature at a time, test, then add the next
- Lovable usually builds more than you specify; small steps help you stay in control
- The rebuild mindset: it's cheap to start over, so experiment freely
- When to tweak vs when to start fresh
- Exercise: Add a new feature to your app, then test it

### 3. Navigate the Lovable Interface
Find your way around without getting lost.

- Preview mode: see your app full-screen, test on mobile
- Code view: you don't need to understand it, but it's there (it gets more useful as you acquire more skills)
- Visual edits: click elements to change text, colours, spacing
- Adding assets: images, logos, and where they live
- Design themes: quick ways to change the overall look
- Exercise: Update three things in your app with the 'Visual edits' tool

### 4. Experiment and Undo Mistakes
Be prepared when something breaks.

- Lovable automatically saves all your changes
- Bookmarking versions: mark stable versions before risky changes
- Reverting: how to go back when something breaks
- When to revert vs when to fix changes
- Exercise: Bookmark your current version, try something risky, then revert

### 5. Go Beyond the Interface
Make your app more complex.

- Planning mode: let Lovable think through complex features before building (but don't over-plan; Lovable works best when you build as you go – explain context rot)
- Knowledge files: give Lovable context it can reference
- API keys and the Secrets panel: where to put them, why never in prompts
- Lovable Cloud: backend features without setup
- Handling security warnings: what they mean and how to respond
- Exercise: Enable planning mode and ask Lovable to add a feature

### 6. Publish Your App
Put your work on the internet.

- Before you publish: favicon, meta tags, thumbnail
- The publish button: what happens when you click it
- Your published URL: it's live, but nobody will find it unless you share it
- Why "not done" is fine: ship early, learn from real use
- The 80/20 reality: getting to 80% takes 20% of the effort; the final 20% takes the remaining 80%
- Products vs projects: apps are never finished, they evolve
- Exercise: Set your favicon and meta tags, then publish
- What to do next: share with one person and ask for feedback

## Narrative Arc

The course follows a confidence progression:

1. **Proof:** I can make something appear with structure (first prompt with formula)
2. **Control:** I can improve it step by step (iteration, small prompts)
3. **Refinement:** I can shape how it looks (visual edits, interface)
4. **Safety:** I can experiment without losing work (bookmarks, reverts)
5. **Depth:** I can add more functionality (planning mode, APIs, cloud)
6. **Shipping:** I can put it in the world (publish, share, iterate)

Each challenge builds on the previous. Learners always have something working; each step makes it better.

## Running Example

The **Book Club Organiser** appears throughout as a worked example:
- Challenge 1: Structured prompt with the full formula to create the app
- Challenge 2: Add a voting feature with a follow-up prompt
- Challenge 3: Visual edits to refine the design
- Challenge 4: Bookmark before adding a risky feature
- Challenge 5: Add a feature using planning mode
- Challenge 6: Publish and share with a friend

Learners can follow along with this example or apply each concept to their own idea.

## Teaching Approach

- **Hands-on from minute one:** Structured prompt formula taught immediately, then learners use it
- **Mindset woven into practice:** "It's cheap to rebuild" taught while they're bookmarking, not in a separate challenge
- **Show the interface:** Screenshots and screen recordings of actual Lovable UI
- **Normalise imperfection:** Encourage publishing before it's "ready"
- **Link to other courses:** Debugging, software basics, and product planning courses referenced where relevant

---

## Skills Covered

- Prompt writing (structured formula, iteration)
- Lovable interface (preview, code view, visual edits, assets, themes)
- Version control (bookmarking, reverting)
- Backend basics (planning mode, knowledge files, API keys, Lovable Cloud)
- Publishing (favicon, meta tags, deployment)

## Timing

Total estimated time: ~45 minutes (designed so learners have a published app by the end)
